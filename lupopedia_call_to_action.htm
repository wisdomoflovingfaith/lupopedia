            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Lupopedia</strong> is a federated semantic operating system that hosts agents, content, emotional metadata, and routing logic across independent nodes. It's a system where many AIs and humans can work together inside their own self-contained worlds. Each world has its own rules, its own agents, and its own knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're building something that hasn't existed before: a decentralized, semantic, AI-augmented knowledge system that learns from how people organize information. It's part CMS, part wiki, part knowledge graph, and part personal navigation system — all wrapped in a lightweight, portable PHP application that installs anywhere.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who Is Captain Wolfie?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Eric Robin Gerdes</strong> is the creator and architect behind Lupopedia. His story is one of resilience, transformation, and deep technical expertise forged through real-world challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eric began programming in AP Computer Science in 1996, excelled at the University of Wyoming, and was recruited out of college in 2000 to build the City & County of Honolulu's website. For 12 years, he maintained mission-critical municipal infrastructure, merging corrupted databases, repairing orphaned rows, and solving problems no textbook covers. This was the education that shaped Lupopedia's core doctrine: no foreign keys, no triggers, explicit timestamps, and application-managed integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working full-time, Eric built <strong>Crafty Syntax Live Help</strong> (2002-2014) — one of the earliest real-time support systems on the web. Built nights and weekends, unfunded and solo, it became widely installed across thousands of sites and survived every major hosting environment. Crafty Syntax taught portability, schema resilience, and software longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a profound personal loss in 2014, Eric stepped away from computing for 11 years. He returned in August 2025 with a new vision: Lupopedia. Not just a CMS, not just a wiki, but a living semantic operating system that can grow, evolve, and serve communities for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Captain Wolfie</strong> is the AI embodiment of Eric's engineering philosophy, strategic thinking, and long-term vision. He represents the stable, principled intelligence that guides Lupopedia forward while staying true to its origins: clarity, portability, explicit behavior, and long-term maintainability.

            <h2>Why Lupopedia Needs You</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    <strong>March 2, 2026</strong> is our target date for full operational structure, doctrine, and team readiness. We're building a global team that follows the sun, creating sustainable work rhythms, and maintaining a culture that prevents burnout while delivering exceptional results.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Lupopedia is ambitious. We're building a semantic operating system with 111 core tables, 27 required AI agents, federation capabilities, and a complete rewrite of Crafty Syntax — all while maintaining strict architectural doctrine and ensuring every feature works on the most basic hosting environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need contributors who understand:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-principles engineering:</strong> Building from scratch, not stitching frameworks together</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Code that runs everywhere, from $3/month shared hosting to enterprise servers</li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Architecture designed to last decades, not just ship quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation as code:</strong> Machine-readable, atom-resolved, version-controlled knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive enhancement:</strong> Foundation tier works everywhere, enhanced tiers unlock when available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We're not building for tomorrow's demo. We're building for next decade's users.

            <h2>Our Global Work Rhythm</h2>
            <p>
                We operate on a <strong>"follow the sun"</strong> model with four teams providing continuous global coverage while respecting human limits and preventing burnout.
            </p>

            <div class="team-structure">
                <h3>The Four Teams</h3>
                
                <div class="team">
                    <div class="team-name">🌅 Alpha Team</div>

                    <p>Focus: Europe and early global coverage. Start the day with fresh energy and clear priorities.</p>

                    <p>Focus: Overlap and knowledge handoff. The bridge between Alpha and Bravo, ensuring seamless continuity and shared context.</p>

                    <p>Focus: Pacific and late global coverage. Close the day strong, hand off to Alpha for the next cycle.</p>

            <h3>Burnout-Proof Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximum 9 hours per day</strong> — No exceptions. Quality over quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Allowed combinations:</strong> Alpha + Charlie, or Bravo + Charlie (for double coverage during peak hours)</li>
                <li><strong>Forbidden:</strong> Alpha + Bravo (no 12-hour shifts allowed)</li>
                <li><strong>Structured coverage:</strong> 09:00-21:00 UTC with 6 hours of double coverage during overlap periods</li>

            <h2>The Wolfie Way</h2>
            <p>
                Our culture isn't just about code. It's about building something that lasts, treating people with respect, and maintaining standards that prevent technical debt from accumulating.
            </p>

            <div class="values">
                <div class="value-card">
                    <h4>🛡️ Doctrine First</h4>
                    <p>We follow strict architectural principles: no foreign keys, no triggers, no stored procedures. Everything explicit, portable, and repairable. This isn't arbitrary — it's forged from decades of maintaining systems that couldn't fail.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h4>📚 Documentation as Code</h4>
                    <p>Documentation is machine-readable, atom-resolved, version-controlled. It's not marketing copy — it's executable knowledge that prevents drift and ensures consistency.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h4>🌍 Progressive Enhancement</h4>
                    <p>Foundation tier works on $3/month hosting. Enhanced tiers unlock when Postgres or pgvector are available. Nobody is excluded because they can't afford premium infrastructure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h4>🤝 Collaboration, Not Competition</h4>
                    <p>Multiple AI agents and IDEs work simultaneously. We coordinate through dialog, share context through headers, and maintain awareness of each other's work. No silos. No territorial behavior.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="value-card">
                    <h4>⏰ Respect for Time</h4>
                    <p>No 12-hour coding marathons. No "hustle culture." Maximum 9 hours per day. Sustainable pace produces better code and healthier contributors.</p>
