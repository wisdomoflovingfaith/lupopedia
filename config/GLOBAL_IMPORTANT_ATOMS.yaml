# GLOBAL IMPORTANT ATOMS - MANIFESTO OF 12
# Purpose: Load-bearing pillars of Lupopedia Semantic OS
# Version: 4.0.45
# Status: HURRICANE KILLER - Foundation stabilization
# ======================================================================

# THE 12 CRITICAL ATOMS (Load-Bearing Pillars)
# These are the only atoms that can survive 400% conceptual velocity
# All other atoms are secondary and may drift without system impact

# IDENTITY ANCHORS (3)
