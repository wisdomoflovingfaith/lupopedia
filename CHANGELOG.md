Development for Lupopedia 4.0.4 has begun.

# Lupopedia Changelog

Canonical version history. Patch-only for 4.0.x. The only valid upgrade path is **Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 → Lupopedia 4.0.x**. No Lupopedia→Lupopedia upgrade paths exist until after 4.1.0.

---

## Lupopedia 4.0.3

- **PHP 5.3+ compatibility:** Sweep across core request paths to remove null coalescing (`??`) and short array syntax (`[]`). Replaced with `isset() ? : ` ternaries and `array()`. Session cookie params use the 5-argument form for PHP 5.3 (no array form, no `samesite`). Files touched: `content-renderer.php`, `index.php`, `bootstrap.php`, `module-loader.php`, `topbar.php`, `actors-controller.php`, `my-profile.php`, `admin.php`, and related layout/view files.
- **Reserved ID doctrine:** Added `.cursor/rules/reserved-id-doctrine.mdc`. Tables for actors, channels, and users do not use AUTO_INCREMENT; IDs are reserved or explicitly allocated. Code must never rely on `lastInsertId()` for these tables; must check if ID exists and then UPDATE or INSERT with explicit ID.
- **Schema (install):** Removed AUTO_INCREMENT from `lupo_actors` and `lupo_auth_users` in `database/migrations/install_new_lupopedia.sql`. Primary keys remain plain bigint; application supplies IDs.
- **`lupo_findpuka()`:** New helper in `lupo-includes/functions/reserved-id-helpers.php` (PHP 5.3–compatible, no namespace). Returns the next available primary-key ID for a given table/column, optionally within a range. Uses PDO_DB only; no AUTO_INCREMENT or lastInsertId(). Loaded from `bootstrap.php`.
- **Insert-path corrections:** All actor and channel (and channel_roles) insert paths updated to use explicit IDs:
  - **ActorService:** `createActorForAuthUser()` uses `lupo_findpuka()` for next `actor_id`, then insert with explicit `actor_id`; returns that ID (no lastInsertId).
  - **LegacyFunctions:** `resolve_actor_from_lupo_user()` uses `lupo_findpuka()` and insert with explicit `actor_id`.
  - **run_labs_handshake.php:** Allocates `actor_id` via `lupo_findpuka()` (fallback to MAX+1), inserts with explicit `actor_id`.
  - **channels-controller.php:** Captain, administrator, and monitor role inserts use `lupo_findpuka()` for `channel_role_id` and INSERT with explicit `channel_role_id`.
  - **AdminUsersHandler:** New channel role uses `lupo_findpuka()` for `channel_role_id` (fallback to MAX+1).
  - **migrate_filesystem_to_db.php:** `createChannelRecord()` allocates `channel_id` with MAX+1 and inserts with explicit `channel_id`; returns that ID (no lastInsertId).
  - **GroundedAgentModel:** `createActorRecord()` allocates `actor_id` with MAX+1, builds full row for `lupo_actors`, inserts and returns allocated `actor_id` (does not use insert_id).
- **My Profile save:** Fixed profile save (e.g. `/my-profile/save`) so updates persist. `lupo_actor_properties` and `lupo_uploads` have no AUTO_INCREMENT; controller now allocates explicit `actor_property_id` and `upload_id` and uses PDO_DB `query`/`fetchRow`/`update`/`insert` only (no raw prepare/execute). TOON-backed column names preserved.
- **Admin Users (OOP):** Admin users section logic moved into non-namespaced class `AdminUsersHandler` in `lupo-includes/classes/AdminUsersHandler.php`. `admin.php` delegates to `AdminUsersHandler::render()` for the Users section.
- **My Profile UI:** Timezone on profile edit page is a dropdown of UTC offsets (decimal style) with human-readable labels (e.g. Central — Chicago, Sioux Falls). Stored in `actor_properties.property_value` as before.
- **Cursor rules:** Added `.cursor/rules/php-5-3-compatibility.mdc` (no `??`, no `[]`, no return types in core, session cookie 5-arg form).

## Lupopedia 4.0.2

- **Helper refactors:** Domain-by-domain migration of helpers to services/wrappers (Collection Zero, Collection Tabs, Saved Collections, Redirect, Limits, Atoms/Version, Upload). Thin wrappers in `lupo-includes/functions/` call into `app/Services` and `app/Support` where applicable.
- **Version doctrine:** Canonical versioning doctrine established: patch-only 4.0.x; only upgrade path Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 → Lupopedia 4.0.x; no Lupopedia→Lupopedia upgrades until 4.1.0. Version fallbacks and examples in code/atoms set to the single current target; stray version references removed.
- **Python scripts:** All Python scripts consolidated under `scripts/`. Generators and utilities moved from `database/` and `dialogs/` into `scripts/`; doctrine updated so Python lives only in `scripts/`.
- **Reserved-word column renames:** One-time migration for MySQL reserved words: `lupo_actor_group_membership.role` → `role_key`, `lupo_artifacts.type` → `entity_type`, `lupo_pack_role_registry.role` → `role_key`. Install schema and API (artifact, timeline) updated accordingly.
- **Doctrine and rules:** Mandatory .cursorrules for zero-installations / no backward compatibility and version lock; LUPOPEDIA_DOCTRINE and related docs updated to reflect current version and upgrade path.

## Lupopedia 4.0.1

- **Architecture rebuild:** Structural changes and Crafty Syntax integration preparation. Legacy agent and channel directories removed; new doctrine and TOON files added; migration SQLs for actor model and related fixes.
- **Login and session:** New login system (MD5 upgrade path, redirect-back, session upgrade). Collection 0 documentation landing and Q/A module with routing consolidation.
- **Channels and edges:** ChannelsController and EdgesController added with routing for channels and edges; placeholder views and 3-panel channel UI skeleton; module-loader and layout updates.
- **Prefix normalization:** Table-prefix normalization completed; tables use dynamic `lupo_` prefix from config; legacy unified tables renamed with `_old` suffix where preserved.
- **Crafty Syntax subsystem:** Operator console activated under crafty_syntax; operator expertise and AI→human escalation engine; routing, controllers, and views for Crafty Syntax module.

## Lupopedia 4.0.0

- Initial Lupopedia release.
- **Upgrade path:** This version only supports new installs or upgrades from **Crafty Syntax 3.7.5**. No Lupopedia→Lupopedia upgrades exist. Lupopedia→Lupopedia upgrade paths do not exist until after version 4.1.0.
