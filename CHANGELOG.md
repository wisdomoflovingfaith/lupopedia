# Note on Versioning and Multiple Changelogs
Lupopedia uses a multi-channel versioning system.

The canonical semantic version history is maintained under:
docs/channels/overview/versioning/CHANGELOG.md

This root-level CHANGELOG.md is a high-level meta-log and does not
represent the full version history of the Semantic OS. Contributors
should refer to the channel-based changelog for authoritative version
increments, doctrine updates, and schema-related notes.

## [2026.1.1.12] - 2026-01-24 20:32:00
- Version boundary synced across canonical changelog and global atoms.
