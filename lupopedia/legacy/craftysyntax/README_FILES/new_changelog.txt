Version 3.7.1:  (  November 9, 2025   )  ================================================================== UPDATES: ------------------------------------------------------------------+ Hardened all public visitor endpoints (livehelp.php, user_connect.php, user_chat_* pages, user_top.php, user_qa.php) to reuse the already-sanitized department / tab / offset integers when generating redirects, query strings, and embedded JavaScript.    + Sanitized visitor-supplied hidden fields in the lost password and chat color forms so that password-reset flows and embedded widgets cannot inject markup when rendered on remote sites.    + This light-touch security patch keeps the legacy behaviour intact while closing the remaining public XSS edges, and serves as the baseline for the LUPOPEDIA migration path that now ships the full CRAFTY SYNTAX codebase.



Version 3.7.0:  (  November 7, 2023   )  ================================================================== UPDATES: ------------------------------------------------------------------+ The previously "pro/unbranded" option that was released in 2017 has now been included as a   selectable config option to remove the powered by CRAFTY SYNTAX link directly from the installation rather   then needing to download and install a special version of files. You can now select to not   show the powered by links by selecting that option in the generate html or department settings.    + Changed all PHP calls to each() which is a depreciated in php 8 to foreach():   // changed this code which will error out in php 8:       while (list($key, $val) = each($what)) { }   // to this code which works:    foreach ($what as $key => $val) { }	   + added missing 3rd parameter of response code to the function header() calls and lower cased the function name from Header() to header()   as of php 8 it is required.  + added default values for undefined variables as a result of no result sql statements that because of no results  never populated a results associative array and thus caused errors in php 8.+ added if condition to check for ghost sessions upon loading the user info if the user has not been inserted yet to prevent null value array errors.+ added default value for global value of $hide to be "N" to prevent undefined error also referenced script defined array   since in php 8 you can not change global values of $_GET array.+ changed the browser_info class to the more updated Browser class. replaced class/browser_info.php with new class class/Browser.php+ the hour parameter is required now as of php 8 and must be cast as a int so updated all mktime() calls.+ the CTabBox class was throwing errors when trying to include files so moved the include file statements to data.php file.+ the generate HTML function on the live help department was referencing the rows   of the department by an associative array instead of ordered array so the references was   throwing undefined errors. this is fixed.FILES CHANGED: ------------------------------------------------------------------    ALL OF THEM.

Version 3.4.4:  (Released: April 23, 2013   ) ==================================================================  SECURITY RELEASE UPDATE: Two very minor security issues were discovered in CRAFTY SYNTAX Live Help. The Patch for both of these is detailed below. Both of these  security issues are VERY MINOR. The admin.php can  not be accessed by the public so the remote file vulnerabiy can only be exploited by operators which makes it very hard to exploit. Additonally it is not executed code so not remote code can be run on  the server.  The full path disclosure allows hackers to see the full path to your installation but nothing more. This has been fixed as well.     1) Remote File Include :   admin.php    if(!(isset($UNTRUSTED['page']))){ $UNTRUSTED['page'] = "scratch.php"; }    http://localhost/path/admin.php?page=[RFI] 2) Full Path Disclosure:  xmlhttp.php     Dork: inurl:"/xmlhttp.php" Notice: Undefined index: whattodo  PATCH FOR ABOVE: 1) Open up admin.php and update line #45 to be:     <frame src="<?php echo $page; ?>?help=<?php echo $UNTRUSTED['help'] . $alttab; ?>" name="contents" scrolling="AUTO" border="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" NORESIZE>    add these lines after line #38:    $page = "scratch.php";if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="scratch.php"){ $page = "scratch.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="mastersettings.php"){ $page = "mastersettings.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="help.php"){ $page = "help.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="edit_layer.php"){ $page = "edit_layer.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="edit_smile.php"){ $page = "edit_smile.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="operators.php"){ $page = "operators.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="departments.php"){ $page = "departments.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="data.php"){ $page = "data.php"; }if($UNTRUSTED['page']=="modules.php"){ $page = "modules.php"; }2) Open up xmlhttp.php and change line #52:    if(empty($UNTRUSTED['whattodo'])){   $UNTRUSTED['whattodo'] = ""; }    remove line #53:     $whattodo = ""; FILES CHANGED: ------------------------------------------------------------------   setup.php, xmlhttp.php, admin.php, navigation.php,
