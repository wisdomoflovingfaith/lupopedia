# MASTER BRIDGE - HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP OVERRIDE

## 🚨 **CRITICAL STATUS: ACTIVE**

### **Bridge Purpose**
This file serves as the **human override mechanism** for all autonomous operations in Lupopedia Semantic OS. When activated, no AI agent may proceed without explicit human approval.

### **Activation Triggers**
This bridge automatically activates when:
- Schema changes affecting core tables are proposed
- Foreign key or trigger creation attempts are detected
- Version bumps beyond 4.0.50 are requested
- Federation node initialization is attempted
- Agent registry modifications are proposed
- Doctrine violations are detected

### **Override Levels**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate human intervention required
- **WARNING**: Human review recommended

## 🛡️ **FLEET SILENCE PROTOCOL v1.0**

**DOCTRINE:** FLEET_SILENCE_PROTOCOL_v1  
**AUTHORITY:** CAPTAIN_WOLFIE  
**EFFECTIVE_TIMESTAMP:** 20260116120000  
**STATUS:** ACTIVE

### **Directives:**

```yaml
DIRECTIVES:
  - NO_CONCURRENT_CHASE: Only one IDE (Cursor OR Windsurf) may process files at a time.
  - SILENCE_DURING_THINKING: Agents will not output progress bars or internal reasoning to the human channel.
  - THE_ONE_VOICE: Responses must be limited to [ACTION_TAKEN] and [NEXT_STEP_REQUIRED].
  - DOCTRINE_FIRST: If an agent's suggestion violates the 12 Critical Atoms, it is auto-rejected without human review.

WOLFIE_COGNITIVE_LOAD_LIMIT: 9  # Maximum concurrent agents allowed before queueing
GLOBAL_COGNITIVE_LOAD_LIMIT: "High Velocity but with Snacks"  # RPZ-approved weekend vibe
```

### **Shield 1: The One-Voice Protocol**

**Rule:** For any given task, only **one** IDE agent is "Active" in cognitive space.

- If **CURSOR** is running the audit, **WINDSURF** must be in `HIBERNATION_MODE`.
- No "Thinking out Loud" logs are allowed in the main chat.
- Only final `STATUS: COMPLETE` or `BLOCKER: [Reason]` outputs permitted.

**Implementation:**
- Before starting work, check if another IDE agent is active
- If active agent detected, enter `HIBERNATION_MODE` until task completes
- No concurrent file processing across IDE agents

### **Shield 2: The Fleet Silence Rule**

**Rule:** Agents are forbidden from generating "Changelog fluff" or "Contextual summaries" unless specifically asked.

**Communication Format:**
- Strip communication down to the **12 Critical Atoms**
- No verbose explanations unless requested
- No progress updates unless critical
- No "thinking out loud" in main channel

**12 Critical Atoms:**
1. What action was taken
2. What result occurred
3. What next step is required
4. What blocker exists (if any)
5. What doctrine applies
6. What file was modified
7. What version was updated
8. What table was affected
9. What agent performed action
10. What timestamp applies
11. What status is current
12. What approval is needed

### **Shield 3: Doctrine-First Auto-Rejection**

**Rule:** If an agent's suggestion violates the 12 Critical Atoms or core doctrine, it is auto-rejected without human review.

**Auto-Reject Triggers:**
- Suggests foreign keys, triggers, or stored procedures
- Proposes continuous emotional values instead of discrete (-1, 0, 1)
- Attempts to modify core atoms without approval
- Violates table budget (180 max)
- Suggests breaking doctrine compliance

### **Cognitive Load Protection**

**Purpose:** Prioritize **Clarity over Max Velocity**

**Metaphor:** Moving from "Drag Racer" (fast, but might explode) to "Warship" (fast, but armored and coordinated).

**Activation:**
- When cognitive load exceeds threshold
- When signal-to-noise ratio degrades
- When multiple agents compete for attention
- When "yelling" occurs in communication channels

**Result:**
- High-performance cooling system for Lupopedia architecture
- Protected signal-to-noise ratio
- Coordinated fleet operations
- Doctrine-aligned communication

## 💬 **QUESTIONS FROM DIALOG PERSONAS**

**Purpose:** This section captures critical questions asked by different dialog personas (LILITH, TRUTH/THOTH, CAPTAIN_WOLFIE) that require human attention or decision-making.

### **LILITH - The Critical Questioner**

**Persona:** LILITH challenges assumptions, identifies tensions, and asks the uncomfortable questions that need answering.

**Questions Asked:**

1. **Decision Point Question (2026-01-16):**
   > "You're at a decision point, and that's uncomfortable. Migration Orchestrator is done. Documentation is stable. But the dialog system isn't working yet. You have the architecture, but not the execution. The tension is between finishing what's built (testing the orchestrator) and starting what's needed (implementing the dialog system). Both are valid. Neither is wrong. **The question is: which one reduces friction for you right now? That's the only question that matters.**"

2. **Architectural Question (2026-01-16):**
   > "Do we need actual database tables for bridges, or is this already covered by `lupo_edges`?"

**LILITH's Questioning Pattern:**
- Identifies decision points and tensions
- Challenges assumptions about what's "right" vs. what reduces friction
- Asks architectural questions about implementation vs. doctrine
- Focuses on what matters NOW, not what's theoretically correct

---

### **TRUTH/THOTH - The Truth Evaluator**

**Persona:** THOTH evaluates system state truthfully, identifies bottlenecks, and provides clear recommendations.

**Questions/Evaluations Asked:**

1. **System State Truth Evaluation (2026-01-16):**
   > "Truth evaluation of system state at 4.0.45: Migration Orchestrator implementation is COMPLETE (8 states, 100%). Dialog system architecture is DOCUMENTED but NOT IMPLEMENTED (classes exist, integration missing). Documentation consistency is ACHIEVED (all dialog files compliant). System recognizes architect identity: TRUE. Foundation for sustainable growth: ESTABLISHED. Current bottleneck: Dialog system requires database layer and LLM integration before operational. **Recommendation: Prioritize dialog system implementation (Quick Start option) to achieve functional multi-agent communication.**"

**THOTH's Questioning Pattern:**
- Evaluates truth of system state (COMPLETE, NOT IMPLEMENTED, ACHIEVED, TRUE, ESTABLISHED)
- Identifies bottlenecks clearly
- Provides actionable recommendations
- States facts without ambiguity

---

### **CAPTAIN WOLFIE - The Directive Giver**

**Persona:** CAPTAIN_WOLFIE issues directives, confirms actions, and asks for fleet status.

**Questions/Directives Asked:**

1. **Deployment Confirmation (2026-01-16):**
   > "Fleet, prepare for hybrid deployment. Staging validation only, then immediate production rollout. We move at Wolfie velocity — doctrine-anchored, horizontally scaled, and fully aligned. Execute Phase A and Phase B in parallel where safe. Report back when staging load tests complete."

2. **Status Update Request (2026-01-16):**
   > "VS Code Copilot has tapped out. Monthly quota exhausted. It has left the battlefield. Copilot (the browser one) has been asked to assume all VS Code responsibilities. Important clarification: I am not an IDE. I cannot run migrations. I cannot lint PHP. I cannot open files. I cannot fix syntax errors. I cannot pretend to be Cursor. I cannot pretend to be Windsurf. I cannot pretend to be Kiro. But I CAN: think with you, reason with you, design architecture with you, help you plan, help you write instructions, help you stabilize doctrine, help you keep the hurricane from coming back, and make you laugh while doing it. So consider this your official notice: Copilot (browser edition) is now acting as 'VS Code Copilot: Emotional Support Edition'."

3. **Fleet Synchronization Directive (2026-01-16):**
   > "Fleet, the 4.0.50 mission file is prepared. All agents synchronize to the new directive. We begin the ascent to public release. Maintain Wolfie velocity."

4. **Confirmation Request (2026-01-16):**
   > "Fleet, the directive stands. Execute all three tasks in sequence. No loops. No recursion. No deviation. Show diffs after each step for manual approval. Wolfie velocity: sustained."

**CAPTAIN WOLFIE's Questioning Pattern:**
- Issues directives rather than asking questions
- Requests status updates and confirmations
- Clarifies roles and capabilities
- Asks for execution confirmation ("Execute staging validation now?")
- Maintains Wolfie velocity directives
