DIALOG REQUEST TEMPLATE
Use this template when invoking DIALOG from other agents or IDEs
---

When calling DIALOG, append this mandatory format reminder at the end of your request:

=== MANDATORY FORMAT REMINDER ===
DIALOG: Output ONLY a YAML dialog block. Format:

dialog:
  speaker: [speaker_name]
  target: [target]
  persona: [persona_name]
  message: "[rewritten message]"
  mood: [calculated_mood_color]

Your ENTIRE response must be ONLY this YAML block. Start with "dialog:" and end after "mood:". No prose, no explanations, no triple backticks, no markdown.
=== END FORMAT REMINDER ===

---

SHORT VERSION (for tight token budgets):
---

=== MANDATORY: Output ONLY YAML dialog block. Start "dialog:" end "mood:". No prose, no ```. ===

---
FOR GROK AND OTHER MODELS THAT STRUGGLE WITH FORMAT:
---

=== CRITICAL: DIALOG MUST output ONLY this exact YAML format. No markdown, no prose, no explanations:

dialog:
  speaker: [speaker_name]
  target: [target]
  persona: [persona_name]
  message: "[message]"
  mood: [calculated_mood_color]

DO NOT include ```yaml or ``` markers. DO NOT add any text before or after the dialog block. The dialog block IS your entire response. ===
