🧩 Notes for Castcade Compatibility
This template is:

fully deterministic

schema‑agnostic

Dreaming‑safe (no interpretive fields)

Witness‑safe (no meta‑layer artifacts)

migration‑safe (no schema mutations)

doctrine‑aligned with 4.2.3

It contains only structural metadata, which is exactly what Castcade needs to parse and maintain file‑sovereignty.
