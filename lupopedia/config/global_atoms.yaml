# Global Atoms Configuration
# Single source of truth for ecosystem-wide metadata used in WOLFIE Headers
#
# Purpose: Prevent Cursor and other agents from rewriting dozens of files
# when global metadata changes (authors, version, copyright, etc.)
#
# Rules:
# - Cursor MUST treat atom names as symbolic references
# - Cursor MUST resolve atom values from this file when reading
# - Cursor MUST preserve symbolic references exactly as written when modifying
# - Cursor MUST NOT generate or modify this file unless explicitly instructed
