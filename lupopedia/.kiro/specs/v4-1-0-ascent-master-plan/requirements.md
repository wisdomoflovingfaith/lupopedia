# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The v4.1.0 Ascent Master Plan orchestrates the execution of three major Big Rocks that transform Lupopedia from its current 4.0.x state into a comprehensive, historically complete, and emotionally rich semantic operating system ready for public release. This master plan ensures coordinated execution, dependency management, and quality assurance across all three major initiatives.

## Glossary

- **Ascent_Orchestrator**: The master coordination system managing all three Big Rocks
- **Big_Rock**: A major feature initiative within the v4.1.0 release
- **Dependency_Manager**: The system managing execution order and inter-rock dependencies
- **Quality_Gate**: Validation checkpoints ensuring readiness before proceeding
- **Release_Coordinator**: The system managing final integration and release preparation
- **Historical_Continuity**: The complete documentation of Lupopedia's evolution from 1996-2026
- **Dialog_Modernization**: The migration from file-based to database-backed dialog system
- **Emotional_Standardization**: The integration of structured emotional metadata protocol
