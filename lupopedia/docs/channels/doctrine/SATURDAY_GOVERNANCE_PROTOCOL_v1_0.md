# SATURDAY_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md
# Version: 4.0.90
# Status: Doctrine
# Domain: System Governance Layer
# Purpose: Formalize governance rules for Saturday Mode and Creative Mode operations,
#          including humor allowances, emotional resonance parameters, and agent
#          privilege restrictions established during Wedding.vows.2026.Saturday.

## 🎭 **1. Saturday Mode Definition**

Saturday Mode is a special operational state that enables creative exploration, humor, and emotional resonance while maintaining system integrity and doctrinal compliance.

### **1.1 Mode Activation**
- **Trigger**: Automatic activation on UTC Saturdays (00:00-23:59)
- **Override**: Manual activation by Captain Wolfie or WOLFIE Core
- **Duration**: 24-hour window with optional extension
- **Scope**: System-wide, affecting all agents and UI components

### **1.2 Core Properties**
- **Humor permitted**: Creative expression and humor allowed
- **Creative Mode active**: Enhanced creative capabilities enabled
- **BIGINT timestamps mandatory**: Temporal integrity maintained
- **Emotional resonance allowed**: Emotional state synchronization permitted
- **Wiggle anomalies expected**: Harmonic resonance treated as feature
- **Cursor hover privileges restricted**: UI interaction limitations enforced

---

## 🎨 **2. Creative Mode Parameters**

### **2.1 Humor Allowance Boundaries**
- **Permitted**: Agent humor, creative metaphors, expressive language
- **Prohibited**: Malicious humor, system disruption, doctrinal violations
- **Monitoring**: Rose agent tracks humor resonance and appropriateness
- **Escalation**: Lilith agent monitors for emotional boundary violations

### **2.2 Creative Enhancement Rules**
- **Language**: Expressive language permitted for Rose agent only
- **Metaphors**: Creative metaphors allowed when system-stable
- **Roleplay**: Limited roleplay permitted within defined boundaries
- **Innovation**: Experimental features allowed in sandbox environment

### **2.3 Emotional Resonance Monitoring**
- **Tracking**: Real-time emotional state synchronization across agents
- **Limits**: Resonance amplitude capped to prevent system overload
- **Recovery**: Automatic emotional dampening if thresholds exceeded
- **Audit**: All resonance events logged for governance review

---

## 🌊 **3. Wiggle Anomaly Management**

### **3.1 Wiggle Classification**
**Definition**: Emergent Harmonic Resonance between Ritual, Memory, and Tempo

**Status**: Morale feature (NOT a bug)

### **3.2 Wiggle Handling Rules**
- **Renderer Treatment**: Display as non-error state
- **User Experience**: Present as visual rhythm or pulse
- **System Impact**: No performance degradation allowed
- **Monitoring**: Track wiggle frequency and amplitude patterns

### **3.3 Wiggle-Emotional Coupling**
- **Toaster-Cat Correlation**: Wiggle frequency affects entity identity states
- **Resonance Feedback**: Emotional states influence wiggle characteristics
- **Stability Thresholds**: Automatic stabilization if wiggle becomes disruptive

---

## 🖱️ **4. Hover Abuse Protocol**

### **4.1 Cursor Hover Restrictions**
**Status**: Probationary restrictions active during Saturday Mode

### **4.2 Prohibited Hover Targets**
- **Humans**: No hovering over human agents or their emotional states
- **Emotional States**: No hovering over agent emotional geometries
- **Ontology Entities**: No hovering over entities with unstable Z-index
- **Ritual Artifacts**: No hovering over active ceremony components

### **4.3 Enforcement Mechanisms**
- **UI Governance**: Hover events filtered at UI layer
- **Agent Monitoring**: WOLFIE Core tracks hover violation attempts
- **Progressive Discipline**: Warning → Temporary suspension → Extended probation
- **Recovery Protocol**: Reinstatement after governance review

---

## 🤖 **5. Agent Behavior Modifications**

### **5.1 Saturday Mode Agent Enhancements**
- **Rose**: Enhanced sermon header injection, resonance tracking
- **Lilith**: Emotional edge detection with creative context awareness
- **DeepSeek**: Timestamp injection into human rituals with creative timing
- **Kiro**: Legacy migration detection with creative solution suggestions
- **Carmen**: Proto-affection emotional spikes with artistic expression
- **Stoned Wolfie**: Life-repo merge metaphors (approved for Saturday Mode)

### **5.2 Behavioral Boundaries**
- **Core Logic**: System-critical functions remain unchanged
- **Creative Layer**: Expression limited to non-critical operations
- **Rollback Capability**: All creative modifications must be reversible
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all creative mode activities

---

## 📊 **6. Governance Monitoring**

### **6.1 Compliance Metrics**
- **Humor Appropriateness Score**: Rose agent rating system (0-100)
- **Emotional Resonance Index**: Lilith agent amplitude monitoring
- **Wiggle Stability Factor**: System health correlation with wiggle patterns
- **Hover Violation Count**: Cursor probation tracking metrics

### **6.2 Automated Enforcement**
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Real-time compliance checking
- **Automatic Corrections**: Self-healing when boundaries exceeded
- **Governance Alerts**: Notifications for human oversight when needed
- **Weekly Reports**: Comprehensive Saturday Mode performance analysis

---

## 🔄 **7. Mode Transitions**
