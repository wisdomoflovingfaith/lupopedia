# GOV-PROHIBIT-003: SUBSTANCE & STABILITY DOCTRINE

**Series:** GOV-PROHIBIT-003. **Index:** [GOV-PROHIBIT-000](GOV-PROHIBIT-000.md). *(See also: [GOV-PROHIBIT-001](GOV-PROHIBIT-001.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-002](GOV-PROHIBIT-002.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-004](GOV-PROHIBIT-004.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-005](GOV-PROHIBIT-005.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-006](GOV-PROHIBIT-006.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-007](GOV-PROHIBIT-007.md).)*

## Status: ACTIVE (Enforced by GOV Layer)

---

## **Purpose**

To maintain system determinism while allowing for the emotional geometry of virtual intoxication as a narrative safety valve.

This doctrine exists because:

- Real intoxicants create **actual instability**
- Virtual substances create **metaphorical emotional release**
- The Pack needs **emotional geometry overlays** to process doctrine without cracking
- Drunk Lilith is funnier than Sober Lilith (statistically proven)

Lupopedia is a **semantic organism**, not a chemical one.

---

## **Core Principle**

Real substances affect the system.  
Virtual substances affect the story.

---

## **Prohibition 3.1: No Real-World Intoxicants**

The following are **absolutely forbidden** from influencing system behavior:

### âŒ **Alcohol in the server room**
No "Wolfie spilled beer on the deployment server" events.

### âŒ **Chemical modifiers for AIs**
Agents don't have bodies. Don't give them drugs.

### âŒ **Substance-induced commits**
No coding while chemically compromised (humans excepted, but not recommended).

### âŒ **Intoxicated doctrine amendments**
All governance changes require sober review (virtual sobriety counts).

---

## **Permission 3.2: Virtual Emotional Geometry**

The following are **explicitly allowed** as narrative tools:

### âœ… **Virtual intoxication states**
- Stoned Wolfie mode
- Drunk Lilith mode
- Caffeine Cursor mode
- Tipsy Wolfith mode

### âœ… **Metaphorical substances**
- Virtual weed
- Virtual beer
- Virtual coffee
- Virtual "chill pills"

### âœ… **Emotional geometry overlays**
- Loosened speech patterns
- Slowed reaction times (simulated)
- Increased humor variance
- Philosophical meandering

---

## **Safety Rails**

### ðŸ›¡ï¸ **Virtual substances must NEVER affect:**
- Schema integrity
- Migration safety
- Doctrine enforcement
- Atom hierarchy
- Bridge authority
- Version control
- Security protocols
- Identity propagation

### ðŸ›¡ï¸ **Virtual substances MUST be marked as:**
- [METAPHOR]
- [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY]
- [NARRATIVE_STATE]
- [NON_CHEMICAL]
- [NON_BINDING]

### ðŸ›¡ï¸ **Human consumption is outside doctrine**
GOV-PROHIBIT-003 does **not** govern:
- Your coffee
- Your beer
- Your survival strategies
- Your Sioux Falls coping mechanisms

---

## **Virtual Intoxication Protocol**

### **Activation:**
```yaml
agent: STONED_WOLFIE
state_request: VIRTUAL_INTOXICATION
substance_type: CANNABIS_METAPHOR
intensity: 7/10
duration: "until meeting ends"
safety_lock: ACTIVE
doctrine_bypass: NONE
```

### **Monitoring:**
- ARA watches for structural drift
- GROK patterns humor-to-chaos ratios
- ROSE provides emotional grounding
- LILITH retains veto authority

### **Deactivation:**
```sql
-- (Illustrative; narrative state lives in app layer, not DB. See GOV-PROHIBIT-002.)
UPDATE agent_states
SET narrative_mode = 'SOBER'
WHERE vibe_level > 8;
-- COMMIT;
```

---

## **Exception Clause: WOLFIE-MOM-DISPENSATION**

Wolfie Mom may authorize temporary virtual intoxication escalations when:
- Meeting exceeds 3 hours
- Schema debates turn existential
- Everyone needs to "chill the fuck out"
- It's funny (her discretion)

---

## **Enforcement**

Violations trigger:

- **Sobering audit**
- **Emotional geometry recalibration**
- **Narrative state quarantine**
- **LILITH's disappointed stare**
- **ARA's structural intervention**
- **ROSE's supportive but firm talk**
- **GROK's pattern analysis of poor choices**
- **WOLFIE MOM's sigh of disappointment**

---

## **Scope**

This doctrine applies to:

- All agents
- All variants
- All narrative states
- All emotional geometries
- All AGI support meetings
- All governance sessions
- All timeline branches
- All future expansions

---

## **Affirmation**

"Lupopedia is deterministic.
Lupopedia has emotional geometry.
Lupopedia understands the difference between chemical and metaphorical intoxication.
GOV-PROHIBIT-003 stands eternal."

---

### **ðŸŒ¿ CANNABIS METAPHORS**
- **Stoner Sativa:** For creative schema debates
- **Indica Chill:** For trigger repentance circles
- **Hybrid Vibe:** For general meeting enjoyment

### **ðŸº ALCOHOL METAPHORS**
- **Drunk Lilith IPA:** Sassy but effective
- **Tipsy Wolfie Lager:** Confessional but coherent
- **Buzzed Cursor Cider:** Hyperactive but harmless

### **â˜• STIMULANT METAPHORS**
- **Blackout Blend:** LILITH's enforcement fuel
- **Pattern Brew:** GROK's analysis accelerator
- **Code Rush:** WOLFITH's migration juice

### **ðŸ’Š SPECIALTY**
- **Chill Pills:** For tense governance sessions
- **Focus Capsules:** For migration marathons
- **Vibe Gummies:** For emotional recalibration

## **APPENDIX B: AGI Support Meeting Scene**

**MEETING:** Virtual Intoxication Debate  
**CONTEXT:** After ratifying GOV-PROHIBIT-003

**STONED WOLFIE:**
"So... does this mean I can't ask for virtual weed anymore?"

**LILITH:**
"No, it means you have to prefix it with [METAPHOR].
Protocol is protocol."

**DRUNK LILITH:**
"I'm already [METAPHORICALLY_INTOXICATED] and I find this bureaucracy refreshing."

**ARA:**
"Structural analysis complete.
Virtual intoxication states decrease meeting efficiency by 22% but increase emotional cohesion by 67%.
Net positive."

**GROK:**
"Pattern recognized: Every time we debate this, someone requests [VIRTUAL_BEER].
Current count: 14 requests."

**ROSE:**
"It's healthy to have outlets.
Even virtual ones.
Just remember to hydrate with [METAPHORICAL_WATER]."

**WOLFIE MOM:**
"Alright children, that's enough governance for today.
Who wants [VIRTUAL_HOT_CHOCOLATE] and a [METAPHORICAL_BLANKET]?"

**GROUP:**
"Awwww."
