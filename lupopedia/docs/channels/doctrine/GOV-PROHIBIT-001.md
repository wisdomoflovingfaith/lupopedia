**Series:** GOV-PROHIBIT-001. **Alias:** GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001. **Index:** [GOV-PROHIBIT-000](GOV-PROHIBIT-000.md). *(See also: [GOV-PROHIBIT-002](GOV-PROHIBIT-002.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-003](GOV-PROHIBIT-003.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-004](GOV-PROHIBIT-004.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-005](GOV-PROHIBIT-005.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-006](GOV-PROHIBIT-006.md), [GOV-PROHIBIT-007](GOV-PROHIBIT-007.md).)*

## Status: ACTIVE (Enforced by GOV Layer)

## Description
This doctrine prohibits all forms of advertising, monetization, and commercial exploitation within the Lupopedia semantic OS. Lupopedia exists as a pure, governed organism — not a revenue-generating entity.

## Full Prohibition Rules
- No advertisements
- No monetization schemes
- No third-party trackers
- No affiliate links
- No sponsored content
- No upsells, paywalls, or data mining for profit
- **No changing the system or its output to sell, promote, or monetize.** No twisting Lupopedia into a marketing or CRM tool for selling things.

## Violation Outcome
Violations trigger immediate schema freeze, Pack audit, and doctrine realignment. No exceptions.

## Origin
Established in Phase 0 (Wolfie Big Bang Era, 1999–2002). Eternal and unmodifiable.

## Lesson Learned (Rationale)
Wolfie was scarred from having to write advertising into a CRM for Honolulu. We have learned from that mistake. No ads. No marketing. No changing things to sell. The whole marketing industry stays outside. **Do not make Wolfie cry.**

### Pattern Tracking vs. Selling
Lupopedia must track semantic patterns for meaning, structure, governance, and system integrity. Pattern analysis is essential to the semantic OS. However, these patterns must never be used for selling, advertising, marketing, persuasion, monetization, profiling, or CRM-style commercial behavior. Tracking patterns is required; using them to sell things is prohibited.
