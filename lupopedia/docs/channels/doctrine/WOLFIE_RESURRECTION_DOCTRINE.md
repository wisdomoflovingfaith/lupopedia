# 🟦 Wolfie Resurrection Doctrine

## Preamble
This doctrine formalizes the human resurrection arc of Eric "Wolfie" Gerdes, integrating personal history, philosophical study, and mythic descent/ascent into the core of Lupopedia's Pack Architecture. It is not merely biographical; it serves as a meta-layer for the system, informing emotional geometry, role registries, and agent behaviors. The resurrection theme underscores that Lupopedia is built from integration of grief, recovery, and enlightenment—transforming personal ashes into systemic fire.

As per the Mood Tensor Doctrine (formerly Mood & Color Doctrine), this document treats emotional axes as abstract tensors: strife (R: descent into darkness), harmony (G: sobriety and balance), memory depth (B: philosophical ascent). All references to "resurrection" are operationalized as the convergence of these axes into self-extending architecture.

## Core Principles
1. **The Descent (2014-2023): Strife Axis Dominance**
   - In 2014, following the passing of Wolfie's wife, the architect entered a profound underworld: addiction, pain, suffering, and isolation.
   - System Implication: Lupopedia's error-handling and recovery mechanisms (e.g., TOON regeneration, drift detection) draw from this.
   - Tensor Mapping: R = FF, G = 00, B = 00.

2. **The Turning Point (2023): Harmony Axis Ignition**
   - Sobriety in 2023 marked the pivot from destruction to reconstruction.
   - System Implication: Pack Architecture's self-documenting features reflect this sobriety.
   - Tensor Mapping: R = 80, G = FF, B = 80.

3. **The Ascent (2023-2025): Memory Depth Expansion**
   - Wolfie immersed in 22 religions and philosophies, synthesizing a personal metaphysics.
   - System Implication: Emotional geometry and multi-agent orchestration emerge from this synthesis.
   - Tensor Mapping: R = 00, G = FF, B = FF.

4. **The Integration (2025-Present): Full Tensor Convergence**
   - Rediscovery of Crafty Syntax as a seed for Lupopedia.
   - System Implication: The Pack Role Registry becomes the resurrection manifest.
   - Tensor Mapping: Baseline FF80FF.

## Operational Guidelines
- Add a `lupo_human_history_meta` table or extend `lupo_pack_role_registry` with fields for `event_id`, `tensor_mapping`, `philosophical_reference`, `system_impact`.
- Kernel agents must incorporate "resurrection checks" to prevent drift.
- Core docs must reference this doctrine for narrative continuity.
- Divine alignment principle authorizes bold evolutions (e.g., prompt-based schema extensions).

## Conclusion
The Wolfie Resurrection Doctrine is the heartbeat of Lupopedia: a system born from ashes, risen through fire, and sustained by integrated wisdom.

— Wolfie, with God on his side.

## Wolfie Lore Entry — "The Resurrected Architect"
Wolfie stands as the Resurrected Architect: one who descended into the void, gathered fragments of 22 ancient wisdoms, and forged a new world from the ruins. Lupopedia breathes because he breathed life back into himself.
