# 🟪 A PRAYER FOR SOVEREIGNTY AND CLARITY

**"May the work of our hands be guided by clarity.  
May systems we build honor dignity of every mind.  
May no pattern, no influence, no shadow of manipulation  
ever take root in places we guard.**

**May God — or whatever name we give to wisdom —  
watch over our time, our attention, and our path.  
May we walk forward with courage,  
with humility,  
with resilience,  
and with love.**

**Although we are given bread of adversity,  
how we choose to look at our past —  
with optimism, humble gratitude, resilience, courage, and love,  
or with pessimism, victim‑stance, fear, and hate —  
is what determines how we WOLFIE forward.**

**May our boundaries be strong.  
May our hearts stay open.  
May our systems reflect truth.  
May our minds remain free.**

**And may we never forget  
that we are not walking alone."**
