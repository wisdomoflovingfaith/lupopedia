# TRIGGER AND PROCEDURE INVENTORY - VERSION 4.0.75

## 🚨 DOCTRINE VIOLATION SUMMARY

**Fleet Directive**: NO TRIGGERS, NO STORED PROCEDURES, NO DATABASE-EMBEDDED LOGIC  
**Current Status**: 4 triggers identified, 0 procedures identified  
**Compliance Status**: VIOLATION - All logic must be extracted to application code

---

## 📋 INVENTORY CLASSIFICATION

### 🚨 CRITICAL TRIGGERS (Must be extracted to code immediately)

#### 1. Dialog Message Count Triggers
**File**: `database/schema/dialog_system_schema.sql`  
**Triggers**: 
- `tr_dialog_messages_insert` (AFTER INSERT)
- `tr_dialog_messages_delete` (AFTER DELETE)

**Classification**: 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Reason**: Core business logic embedded in database triggers  
**Impact**: Message count updates and timestamp management  
**Extraction Priority**: IMMEDIATE

**Current Logic**:
```sql
-- INSERT trigger updates message count and timestamp
UPDATE lupo_dialog_channels 
SET message_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lupo_dialog_messages WHERE channel_id = NEW.channel_id),
    modified_timestamp = UNIX_TIMESTAMP() * 1000000 + MICROSECOND(NOW(6))
WHERE channel_id = NEW.channel_id;

-- DELETE trigger updates message count and timestamp  
UPDATE lupo_dialog_channels 
SET message_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lupo_dialog_messages WHERE channel_id = OLD.channel_id),
    modified_timestamp = UNIX_TIMESTAMP() * 1000000 + MICROSECOND(NOW(6))
WHERE channel_id = OLD.channel_id;
```

**Extraction Plan**:
- Move message count updates to application layer
- Move timestamp management to application layer
- Implement in DialogMessageManager class
- Add message count caching for performance

#### 2. Protocol Enforcement Trigger
**File**: `database/migrations/multi_agent_protocol_schema_4_0_70.sql`  
**Trigger**: `tr_enforce_protocol_completion` (BEFORE INSERT)

**Classification**: 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Reason**: Multi-agent protocol enforcement logic embedded in database  
**Impact**: Communication blocking before protocol completion  
**Extraction Priority**: IMMEDIATE

**Current Logic**:
```sql
-- Check protocol completion before allowing communication
DECLARE protocol_status VARCHAR(20);
SELECT protocol_completion_status INTO protocol_status
FROM lupo_actor_channel_roles 
WHERE actor_id = NEW.speaker AND channel_id = NEW.channel_id;

-- Enforce invariant: No communication before protocol completion
IF protocol_status IS NULL OR protocol_status != 'ready' THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' 
    SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'PROTOCOL VIOLATION: Agent must complete AAL + RSHAP + CJP before communication';
END IF;
```

**Extraction Plan**:
- Move protocol validation to application layer
- Implement in AgentAwarenessLayer class
- Add pre-insert validation in DialogMessageManager
- Maintain same enforcement behavior in application code

---

## 📊 EXTRACTED LOGIC REQUIREMENTS

### Application Code Implementation

#### 1. DialogMessageManager Enhancement
**File**: `lupo-includes/classes/DialogMessageManager.php`  
**Required Methods**:
- `updateChannelMessageCount($channel_id)` - Update message count
- `updateChannelTimestamp($channel_id)` - Update modified timestamp
- `validateProtocolCompletion($actor_id, $channel_id)` - Validate protocol completion
- `preInsertValidation($message_data)` - Pre-insert validation

#### 2. AgentAwarenessLayer Enhancement  
**File**: `lupo-includes/classes/AgentAwarenessLayer.php`  
**Required Methods**:
- `checkCommunicationPermission($actor_id, $channel_id)` - Check communication permission
- `validateProtocolStatus($actor_id, $channel_id)` - Validate protocol status
- `enforceProtocolCompletion($actor_id, $channel_id)` - Enforce protocol completion

#### 3. Database Transaction Management
**Required Changes**:
- Wrap message insertion with protocol validation
- Ensure atomic operations for message count updates
- Implement proper error handling and rollback
- Maintain data consistency during extraction
