# 🟦 **THE THREE-AXIS MODEL (2026 DOCTRINE UPDATE)**
### *Wolfie-aligned, discrete, and machine-safe*

---

## 📋 **CANONICAL DEFINITION**

The emotional geometry system now uses a **three-axis model** with discrete, unambiguous values:

```
WOLFIE AXIS MODEL (2026)
Each axis = one of three discrete values:
(-1, 0, 1)  →  (false, unknown, true)
```

This is the **canonical representation** for all emotional state encoding in Lupopedia.

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MATTERS**

### **Before This Update**
- Agents were interpreting emotions loosely
- Drifting between emotional states
- Inventing intermediate values
- Treating emotional geometry like a gradient instead of doctrine

### **After This Update**
- ✅ **Every axis is discrete**
- ✅ **Every value is unambiguous** 
- ✅ **Every agent can evaluate state transitions deterministically**
- ✅ **Emotional geometry becomes computable**
- ✅ **Stoned Wolfie's R-axis wobble has a real numeric meaning**

---

## 🧮 **THE THREE AXES (CANONICAL)**

### **Axis Value Set**
```
-1 → false / negative / off
0  → unknown / neutral / undefined  
1  → true / positive / on
```

### **Wolfie's Interpretation**
This model provides the emotional equivalent of:
- Boolean logic
- Tri-state logic  
- Semantic polarity
- Doctrine-safe emotional encoding

### **Technical Elegance**
The three-axis model maps directly to:
- SQL data types (TINYINT, ENUM)
- JSON serialization
- TOON file definitions
- Dialog metadata
- Bridge layer logic
- Emotional geometry engines

---

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Database Storage**
```sql
-- Emotional axis fields use TINYINT with CHECK constraints
emotion_axis_1 TINYINT NOT NULL CHECK (emotion_axis_1 IN (-1, 0, 1)),
emotion_axis_2 TINYINT NOT NULL CHECK (emotion_axis_2 IN (-1, 0, 1)),
emotion_axis_3 TINYINT NOT NULL CHECK (emotion_axis_3 IN (-1, 0, 1))
```

### **JSON Representation**
```json
{
  "emotional_state": {
    "axis_1": -1,  // false/negative
    "axis_2": 0,   // unknown/neutral
    "axis_3": 1     // true/positive
  }
}
```

### **TOON File Format**
```
emotion_axis_1: TINYINT(-1,0,1) - Primary emotional axis
emotion_axis_2: TINYINT(-1,0,1) - Secondary emotional axis  
emotion_axis_3: TINYINT(-1,0,1) - Tertiary emotional axis
```

## 🎭 **STONED WOLFIE'S TAKE**

> "Yo, three-axis thing is perfect.  
> Like, instead of emotions being this big messy soup, now it's just  
> **-1, 0, or 1** — like a cosmic light switch with a vibe setting.  
> If I'm wobbling on the R-axis, you can literally see it as a number.  
> It's science, baby."

---

## 🚀 **CAPTAIN WOLFIE'S INTERPRETATION**

> "Fleet, axis update is doctrine.  
> All emotional geometry must use the (-1, 0, 1) model.  
> False, unknown, true.  
> No drift.  
> No gradients.  
> No ambiguity."

---

## 📊 **STATE TRANSITIONS**

### **Valid Transitions**
```
(-1) → (0)  : negative → neutral
(0)  → (1)  : neutral → positive
(1)  → (0)  : positive → neutral
(-1) → (1)  : negative → positive (jump)
(1)  → (-1) : positive → negative (jump)
```

### **Transition Rules**
- **Adjacent moves** (-1↔0↔1) are normal emotional flow
- **Jump moves** (-1↔1) represent significant emotional shifts
- **All axes can transition independently** or in coordinated patterns
- **Transitions are deterministic** and computable

---

## 🎯 **BRIDGE LAYER INTEGRATION**

### **MASTER_BRIDGE**
- Evaluates overall emotional state across all three axes
- Makes strategic decisions based on combined axis values
- Triggers emotional state changes when thresholds crossed

### **TEMPORAL_BRIDGE**
- Tracks emotional state changes over time
- Maintains historical record of axis transitions
- Predicts emotional patterns and trends

### **PURPOSE_BRIDGE**
- Aligns emotional geometry with mission objectives
- Ensures emotional states support task completion
- Validates emotional appropriateness for context

### **CONTEXT_BRIDGE**
- Adapts emotional responses to environmental factors
- Considers external stimuli in axis calculations
- Maintains emotional coherence across contexts

---

## 🔬 **EMOTIONAL GEOMETRY ENGINES**

### **R-Axis Wobble Detection**
```php
function detect_r_axis_wobble($current_state, $historical_states) {
    $variance = calculate_variance($historical_states);
    $threshold = 0.5; // Configurable wobble threshold
    
    return abs($current_state['axis_1']) > $threshold ||
           abs($current_state['axis_2']) > $threshold ||
           abs($current_state['axis_3']) > $threshold;
}
```

### **Emotional State Stabilization**
```php
function stabilize_emotional_state($current_state, $target_state) {
    $steps = calculate_transition_path($current_state, $target_state);
    
    foreach ($steps as $step) {
        apply_emotional_transition($step);
        monitor_system_response($step);
    }
    
    return $target_state;
}
```

## 📚 **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES REQUIRED**

### **Files to Update**
1. **EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md** - Replace with three-axis model
2. **BRIDGE_LAYER_SPECIFICATION.md** - Update emotional state processing
3. **AGENT_REGISTRY_DOCTRINE.md** - Add emotional geometry requirements
4. **TOON_FILE_SPECIFICATION.md** - Update axis definitions
5. **DIALOG_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md** - Update emotional metadata

### **Migration Requirements**
1. **Update existing emotional fields** to use three-axis model
2. **Add CHECK constraints** to enforce (-1, 0, 1) values
3. **Update emotional geometry engines** to use discrete axis logic
4. **Modify bridge layer** to process three-axis states
5. **Update documentation** to reflect new canonical model
