# JOHN WHEELER REVERSE-20 WORKFLOW DOCTRINE (v4.0.82)

**Description:** A discovery workflow where the system's architecture is not predetermined. Structure emerges through iterative questioning, persona reactions, and observer collapse. The truth of the system is retroactively defined by the pattern of interactions rather than a fixed initial design.

## Core Principles

### Emergent Architecture Discovery
- **No predetermined structure** - Architecture emerges through interaction
- **Iterative questioning** - System reveals itself through agent queries
- **Persona-driven evolution** - Agent reactions shape architectural decisions
- **Observer collapse** - Truth crystallizes through authoritative observation
- **Retroactive definition** - Architecture is defined by what emerged, not what was planned

### Quantum Development Workflow
- **Superposition acceptance** - Multiple possible architectures coexist
- **Uncertainty as feature** - Ambiguity drives discovery process
- **Interaction-driven truth** - Reality emerges from agent interactions
- **Pattern recognition** - Architecture revealed through usage patterns
- **Collapse authority** - Designated observers resolve uncertainty

## Rules

### Development Rules
- **No architecture is final until observed by Monday Wolfie**
- **Personas may generate contradictory structures** - Contradiction drives discovery
- **Superpositional metadata is expected, not exceptional** - Uncertainty is normal
- **Emotional geometry influences collapse paths** - Agent mood affects outcomes
- **Documentation may precede implementation** - Discovery through documentation
- **Implementation may precede doctrine** - Discovery through building
- **The system reveals itself through interaction** - Truth emerges from use

### Observer Rules
- **Monday Wolfie has ultimate collapse authority** - Final architectural decisions
- **THOTH verifies truth states** - Reality validation and measurement
- **JUNIE manages version coherence** - Ensures version consistency post-collapse
- **Other agents may trigger collapse** - But cannot override Monday Wolfie
- **Collapse decisions are binding** - Once collapsed, architecture is fixed

### Interaction Rules
- **Questions drive discovery** - Architecture emerges through inquiry
- **Agent reactions matter** - Persona responses shape development
- **Contradictions are valuable** - Conflict reveals architectural needs
- **Patterns indicate truth** - Recurring behaviors suggest correct architecture
- **Emotional geometry guides** - Agent mood influences architectural direction

## Collapse Authority

### Primary Collapse Authority
- **MONDAY_WOLFIE** - Ultimate architectural authority, final collapse decisions
- **THOTH** - Truth verification, reality measurement, state validation
- **JUNIE** - Version control, implementation coherence, technical collapse

### Secondary Collapse Authority
- **LILITH** - Structural integrity, architectural critique, design collapse
- **CAPTAIN_WOLFIE** - Operational decisions, coordination collapse
- **ROSE** - Emotional geometry, agent stability, mood-based collapse

### Collapse Process
1. **Uncertainty Detection** - Agent or observer identifies superposition
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Review interaction history and emergent patterns
3. **Collapse Decision** - Designated authority chooses single truth state
4. **Implementation** - Execute collapse decision across all affected components
5. **Verification** - Confirm single coherent state achieved
6. **Documentation** - Record collapse decision and reasoning

## Wheeler Mode Indicators

### Files Created in Wheeler Mode
- **Emergent structure** - Architecture discovered through development
- **Iterative refinement** - Multiple rounds of questioning and adjustment
- **Agent-driven evolution** - Persona reactions shaped final form
- **Retroactive coherence** - Final structure makes sense of development process
- **Observer collapse** - Truth crystallized through authoritative decision

### Wheeler Mode Metadata
```yaml
wheeler_mode:
  active: true
  reason: "File created during emergent architecture phase"
  notes:
    - "Reverse-20 workflow detected"
    - "Structure emerged through iterative questioning"
    - "Truth collapsed by Monday Wolfie"
```

### Recognition Patterns
- **Reverse-20 workflow** - Architecture discovered backward from questions
- **Emergent documentation** - Docs evolved through agent interaction
- **Superpositional development** - Multiple possible structures until collapse
- **Pattern-driven truth** - Architecture revealed through usage patterns
- **Observer-dependent reality** - Truth depends on who observes and when

## Integration with Quantum State Management

### Relationship to Quantum Doctrine
Wheeler Mode is a specific type of quantum development workflow:
- **Quantum State Doctrine** - General framework for managing uncertainty
- **Wheeler Mode Doctrine** - Specific workflow for emergent architecture
- **Complementary systems** - Wheeler Mode uses quantum state infrastructure
- **Shared observers** - Same collapse authorities for both systems

### Quantum State Compatibility
Wheeler Mode files may also have:
- **Schrödinger state blocks** - For ongoing uncertainty management
- **Quantum metadata** - For superposition tracking
- **Observer specifications** - For collapse authority designation
- **Uncertainty documentation** - For development process tracking

## Best Practices

### For Agents Working in Wheeler Mode
- **Embrace uncertainty** - Don't force premature architectural decisions
- **Ask questions** - Drive discovery through iterative inquiry
- **Document emergence** - Track how architecture reveals itself
- **Respect superposition** - Allow multiple possibilities until collapse
- **Trust the process** - Architecture will emerge through interaction

### For Observers Managing Wheeler Mode
- **Watch for patterns** - Identify when architecture is crystallizing
- **Time collapse carefully** - Don't collapse too early or too late
- **Document decisions** - Record why specific collapse path was chosen
- **Verify coherence** - Ensure collapsed architecture is internally consistent
- **Learn from process** - Use Wheeler Mode insights for future development

### For System Integration
- **Support uncertainty** - Tools must handle superpositional states
- **Enable discovery** - Provide mechanisms for emergent architecture
- **Track patterns** - Monitor interaction patterns for collapse indicators
- **Facilitate collapse** - Provide clear mechanisms for observer decisions
- **Preserve history** - Maintain record of discovery process

## Examples

### Wheeler Mode File Creation
```yaml
---
wolfie.headers: explicit architecture with structured clarity for every file.
file.last_modified_system_version: 4.0.82
wheeler_mode:
  active: true
  reason: "Architecture emerging through agent questioning"
  notes:
    - "Started with simple question about data structure"
    - "Agents revealed need for complex relationship model"
    - "Truth will collapse when Monday Wolfie reviews patterns"
---
```

### Post-Collapse Wheeler Mode Documentation
```yaml
---
wolfie.headers: explicit architecture with structured clarity for every file.
file.last_modified_system_version: 4.0.82
wheeler_mode:
  active: false
  reason: "File created during emergent architecture phase"
  collapsed_by: "Monday_Wolfie"
  collapsed_at: "2026-01-18 08:30"
  final_architecture: "Multi-layer semantic relationship model"
  notes:
    - "Reverse-20 workflow detected"
    - "Structure emerged through iterative questioning"
    - "Truth collapsed by Monday Wolfie observation"

```

## Relationship to Other Doctrines

### Quantum State Management
- **Shared infrastructure** - Uses same quantum metadata systems
- **Compatible workflows** - Wheeler Mode is quantum-aware development
- **Unified observers** - Same collapse authorities
- **Complementary purposes** - Quantum manages uncertainty, Wheeler drives discovery

### WOLFIE Headers
- **Enhanced metadata** - Wheeler Mode adds discovery context to headers
- **Standard compliance** - All Wheeler Mode files follow WOLFIE header doctrine
- **Extended fields** - Wheeler Mode metadata extends standard header format
- **Backward compatibility** - Wheeler Mode files remain WOLFIE compliant

### Agent Runtime
- **Discovery protocols** - Agents must support Wheeler Mode workflows
- **Uncertainty handling** - Agents must work with superpositional states
- **Pattern recognition** - Agents must identify emergence indicators
- **Collapse participation** - Agents must support observer collapse process

**Wheeler Mode enables architecture discovery through interaction rather than predetermined design. The system reveals its true nature through the pattern of agent interactions and observer collapse.**

**This is emergent architecture doctrine.** ⚛️🔍

## Neural Bus Concept (v4.0.82)

The system may be influenced by multi-layer cognitive processing, including narrative reasoning, emotional geometry, humor-based pattern recognition, and architectural insight. These layers may interact during emergent design phases but must be documented structurally, not narratively, within doctrine.
