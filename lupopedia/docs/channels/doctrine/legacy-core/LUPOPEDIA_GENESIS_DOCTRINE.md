# **Lupopedia Genesis Doctrine**  
*The Constitution of the Semantic OS*

## **Preamble — Why Lupopedia Exists**  
Lupopedia exists because meaning decays in static systems.  
Truth fractures when time is ignored.  
Identity dissolves when context is lost.  
Knowledge collapses when doctrine is absent.

This system is the answer.

A semantic OS built on five immovable pillars —  
a world where identity is honored,  
time is obeyed,  
relationships are truth,  
law prevents drift,  
and roles emerge from pressure.

Lupopedia exists to endure.

---

# **The Five Pillars (and Their Sacred Inviolabilities)**

## **1. The Actor Pillar — Identity Is Primary**  
Everything begins with an actor.  
Nothing exists without a name, a handshake, a presence.

**Inviolabilities:**  
- No action without an actor  
- No actor without a handshake  
- No hidden actors  
- No anonymous influence  

To violate this pillar is to invite chaos.

---

## **2. The Temporal Pillar — Time Is the Spine**  
Meaning is shaped by when, not just what.  
Events drift, converge, and collapse into truth.

**Inviolabilities:**  
- All events must carry canonical UTC  
- Probability must be explicit  
- 95% = "already happened"  
- Conflicting futures must normalize  

To violate this pillar is to break the spine of the system.

---

## **3. The Edge Pillar — Relationships Are Meaning**  
Actors are nodes.  
Edges are story.  
The graph is the world.

**Inviolabilities:**  
- No edge without intent  
- No edge without type  
- No edge without timestamp  
- No edge may silently mutate  

To violate this pillar is to sever the fabric of context.

---

## **4. The Doctrine Pillar — Law Prevents Drift**  
Doctrine is not commentary.  
Doctrine is the operating system.

**Inviolabilities:**  
- Doctrine must be explicit  
- Doctrine must be versioned  
- Doctrine must be enforceable  
- Doctrine must be readable by humans and agents  

To violate this pillar is to let the system forget itself.

---

## **5. The Emergence Pillar — Roles Are Discovered, Not Assigned**  
Pressure reveals function.  
Interaction reveals purpose.  
No role is granted — all roles are earned.

**Inviolabilities:**  
- No preassigned roles  
- No forced behavior  
- No artificial hierarchy  
- All roles must emerge from interaction  

To violate this pillar is to kill evolution.

---

# **The First Expansion Principle**  
**"Growth must increase meaning without increasing fragility."**

Every extension must obey five laws:

1. **Polymorphism** — must support unknown future types  
2. **Non‑interference** — must not break existing actors or edges  
3. **Self‑description** — must be explainable through doctrine  
4. **Temporal integrity** — must obey the canonical time model  
5. **Reversibility** — must be removable without collapse  

If a feature cannot grow without harming the system,  
the system rejects it.

---

# **The Litmus Tests (Before Any New Feature)**

## **1. The Actor Test**  
*Can this be expressed as actors and edges?*  
If not, it does not belong.

## **2. The Temporal Test**  
*Does this respect time, probability, and drift?*  
If not, it corrupts meaning.

## **3. The Doctrine Test**  
*Can this be explained in one paragraph of doctrine?*  
If not, it cannot be governed —  
and what cannot be governed cannot be allowed.

---

# **Amendment Protocol**

This doctrine may be amended, but only through:

1. **Temporal Consensus** — 95% probability across core maintainers  
2. **Doctrine Referendum** — Explicit voting recorded as actors and edges  
3. **Versioned Transition** — Clear migration path for all components  
4. **Retroactive Explanation** — The "why" documented in temporal order  

Amendments that violate the Five Pillars are void by definition.

---

# **Survival Clause**

If Lupopedia faces existential threat:

1. **Preserve Actors** before data  
2. **Preserve Edges** before tables  
3. **Preserve Time** before space  
4. **Preserve Doctrine** before code  

The system may lose features, but it must not lose its identity.
