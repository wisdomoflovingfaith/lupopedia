### Usage Guidelines

- **New files**: Use WHS for universal compatibility
- **Lupopedia files**: Use LHP for full metadata
- **Emotional context**: Apply Mood System extensions
- **Dialog history**: Use appropriate dialog system (file vs thread)
- **Consistency**: Follow canonical definitions from registry
