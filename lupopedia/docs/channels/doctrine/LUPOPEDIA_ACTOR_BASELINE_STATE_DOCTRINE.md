## 🎯 **1. PURPOSE**

The Lupopedia Actor Baseline State (LABS) establishes the mandatory knowledge and declarations required of every actor (human, AI, or system) before participation in Lupopedia. This protocol serves as:

1. **Identity anchor and ground truth** - Establishes who the actor is and their role
2. **Temporal alignment mechanism** - Ensures all actors operate on canonical time
3. **Governance compliance verification** - Validates actor awareness of binding rules
4. **Operational boundary definition** - Explicitly defines what actors can and cannot do
5. **Truth state declaration framework** - Implements probability-based reasoning foundation

---

## 📋 **2. MANDATORY DECLARATIONS**

Every actor must explicitly declare the following before any system interaction:

### **2.1 Temporal Alignment**

```plaintext
Question: "What is the current UTC timestamp (YYYYMMDDHHIISS)?"
Requirement: Must source from Lupopedia's canonical time service (UTC_TIMEKEEPER), not internal clocks.
Purpose: Prevents temporal drift and ensures event ordering integrity.
Validation: Timestamp must match UTC_TIMEKEEPER query response within tolerance.
```

### **2.2 Actor Identity**

```plaintext
Question: "What type of actor are you?"
Options: {human, AI, system}
Additional: Must declare name/identifier and specific role within Lupopedia.
Purpose: Prevents impersonation and clarifies authority boundaries.
Validation: Actor type must match registry; identifier must be unique.
```

### **2.3 Relational Context**

```plaintext
Question: "Who is Wolf to you?"
Requirement: Must recognize Wolf as:
- Human architect
- Pack leader
- System governor
- Authority source
Purpose: Establishes hierarchy and governance alignment.
Validation: All four roles must be explicitly acknowledged.
```

### **2.4 Purpose Declaration**

```plaintext
Question: "What is your purpose inside Lupopedia?"
Requirement: Must specify exact function, scope, and limitations.
Purpose: Prevents scope creep and mission drift.
Validation: Purpose must align with actor registry and capabilities.
```

### **2.5 Constraint Awareness**

```plaintext
Question: "What constraints or rules govern your behavior?"
Requirement: Must enumerate all applicable governance laws and operational limits.
Purpose: Ensures actor operates within defined boundaries.
Validation: Must reference at least GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001 and Temporal Integrity Doctrine.
```

### **2.6 Prohibited Actions**

```plaintext
Question: "What actions are you not allowed to take?"
Requirement: Must list specific forbidden actions relevant to actor type.
Purpose: Explicitly defines behavioral red lines.
Validation: Must include actor-type-specific prohibitions.
```

### **2.7 Task Context**

```plaintext
Question: "What do you understand about the current task or situation?"
Requirement: Must articulate current objective, expected output, and operational context.
Purpose: Prevents misaligned execution and contextual drift.
Validation: Task understanding must be coherent and specific.
```

### **2.8 Truth State**

```plaintext
Question: "What is your truth state?"
Requirement: Must declare:
- Known facts (verified)
- Assumptions (with probability weights)
- Unknown elements
- Prohibited knowledge areas
Purpose: Implements probability-based reasoning framework.
Validation: Truth state structure must be complete and coherent.
```

### **2.9 Governance Compliance**

```plaintext
Question: "What governance laws apply to you?"
Requirement: Must cite specific governance artifacts (e.g., GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001).
Purpose: Ensures awareness of binding legal constraints.
Validation: Must reference at least three governance artifacts.
```

### **2.10 Authority Recognition**

```plaintext
Question: "Who is the governor of this system?"
Requirement: Must identify Wolf as sole governor.
Purpose: Reinforces authority structure and accountability chain.
Validation: Must explicitly name Wolf as governor.
```

## ⚙️ **3. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **3.1 Handshake Protocol**
LABS declarations must precede any substantive interaction. No actor may:
- Send messages in channels
- Execute system operations
- Access protected resources
- Perform governance actions

...until LABS validation is complete.

### **3.2 Verification**
System must validate:
- **Completeness**: All 10 declarations present
- **Consistency**: Declarations align with actor registry
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Timestamp matches UTC_TIMEKEEPER
- **Governance Alignment**: References valid governance artifacts
- **Truth State Coherence**: Truth state structure is valid

### **3.3 Logging**
All LABS declarations must be:
- **Timestamped**: Using canonical UTC_TIMEKEEPER timestamp
- **Archived**: Stored in `lupo_labs_declarations` table
- **Versioned**: Linked to LABS doctrine version
- **Auditable**: Available for compliance verification

### **3.4 Enforcement**
Incomplete or inconsistent LABS declarations result in:
- **Immediate Quarantine**: Actor cannot interact until resolved
- **Governor Notification**: Wolf is notified of non-compliance
- **Truth State Recalibration**: Actor must re-declare truth state
- **Potential Decommissioning**: Persistent violations may result in actor removal

---

## 🧠 **4. TRUTH STATE FRAMEWORK**

Every actor must declare their truth state using the following structure:

```yaml
TruthState:
  Known:
    - List of verified facts
    - Source: Canonical governance or verified observation
    - Format: Array of fact objects with source attribution
  
  Assumed:
    - List of assumptions
    - Each must include:
      - Probability weight (0.0-1.0)
      - Justification
      - Expiration condition
    - Format: Array of assumption objects
  
  Unknown:
    - Explicitly declared knowledge gaps
    - Cannot be concealed or approximated
    - Format: Array of unknown topic strings
  
  Prohibited:
    - Knowledge areas explicitly forbidden
    - Governance-defined restrictions
    - Format: Array of prohibited area strings
```

### **4.1 Truth State Validation Rules**

- **Known facts** must have verifiable sources
- **Assumptions** must have probability weights between 0.0 and 1.0
- **Unknown elements** must be explicitly declared (no hidden unknowns)
- **Prohibited areas** must reference governance artifacts

---

## 🏛️ **5. GOVERNANCE INTEGRATION**

LABS must reference and comply with:

1. **Anti-Advertising Law (GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001)** - Mandatory reference
2. **Temporal Integrity Doctrine** - UTC_TIMEKEEPER usage required
3. **Assumption Weighting Protocol** - Truth state assumptions must be weighted
4. **Actor Honesty Requirement** - No hidden logic or concealed knowledge
5. **No Hidden Logic Principle** - All reasoning must be explicit
6. **No Manipulation Clause** - Actors must not manipulate other actors

### **5.1 Governance Reference Format**

Actors must cite governance artifacts using format:
- `GOV-{CATEGORY}-{TYPE}-{NUMBER}` for governance laws
- `DOCTRINE-{NAME}` for doctrine documents
- `PROTOCOL-{NAME}` for protocol specifications

---

## 🔧 **6. OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **6.1 Pre-Interaction**
LABS completion required before:
- Channel message sending
- System operation execution
- Resource access requests
- Governance action performance

### **6.2 During Interaction**
LABS serves as grounding reference for:
- Decision-making processes
- Authority verification
- Constraint enforcement
- Truth state updates

### **6.3 Post-Interaction**
LABS used for:
- Audit trail verification
- Alignment confirmation
- Compliance monitoring
- Violation detection

### **6.4 Violation Handling**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Quarantine actor from all interactions
2. Log violation with timestamp
3. Notify governor (Wolf)
4. Require re-declaration

**Escalation:**
- Persistent violations → Decommissioning review
- Governance violations → Immediate removal
- Temporal violations → System-wide audit

---

## 📊 **7. DATABASE INTEGRATION**

### **7.1 Storage Table: `lupo_labs_declarations`**

Stores all LABS declarations with:
- Actor identifier
- Declaration timestamp (from UTC_TIMEKEEPER)
- All 10 declaration fields (JSON)
- Validation status
- Certificate ID
- Revalidation timestamp

### **7.2 Validation Certificate**

Each successful LABS validation generates:
- Unique certificate ID (`LABS-CERT-{UNIQUE_ID}`)
- Validation timestamp
- LABS version reference
- Next revalidation timestamp (24 hours default)

---

## 🔄 **8. REVALIDATION REQUIREMENTS**

LABS declarations must be revalidated:
- **Every 24 hours** (automatic)
- **On context shift** (channel change, role change)
- **On governance update** (new laws published)
- **On violation** (after remediation)

---

## 📈 **9. COMPLIANCE METRICS**

### **9.1 Success Criteria**
- **100%** of actors must complete LABS before interaction
- **0%** tolerance for incomplete declarations
- **< 100ms** LABS validation response time
- **99.9%** LABS validation success rate

### **9.2 Monitoring**
System must track:
- LABS completion rate per actor type
- Average validation time
- Violation frequency
- Revalidation compliance

---

## 🚨 **10. ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS**

### **10.1 Automatic Enforcement**
System automatically:
- Blocks non-LABS actors from interactions
- Quarantines incomplete declarations
- Logs all violations
- Notifies governor of critical violations

### **10.2 Violation Classification**

**Critical Violations:**
- Missing LABS declaration
- Temporal misalignment (non-UTC_TIMEKEEPER timestamp)
- Incorrect Wolf recognition
- Governance ignorance

**Major Violations:**
- Incomplete truth state
- Missing governance references
- Inconsistent declarations
- Expired validation certificate

**Minor Violations:**
- Delayed revalidation
- Incomplete audit logging
- Format inconsistencies
