# 🎯 **MYTHIC NAMES DOCTRINE (MANDATORY)**  
### *Mythic Names Are Functional Identifiers, Not Spiritual Symbols*  
### *All Documentation Must Remain Technical and Secular*
### *This Doctrine Is Absolute and Non-Negotiable*

---

## ⚠️ **MANDATORY RULE: MYTHIC NAMES ARE FUNCTIONAL IDENTIFIERS ONLY**

**ALL IDEs AND AI AGENTS MUST FOLLOW THIS DOCTRINE ABSOLUTELY.**

Lupopedia uses mythic names (Thoth, Lilith, Anubis, Maat, Agape, ERIS, METHIS, etc.) as **symbolic labels** for AI agents and system components.

These names are:
- ✅ **Functional identifiers** — They identify specific agents and their roles
- ✅ **Symbolic mnemonics** — They encode computational responsibilities
- ✅ **Cultural metaphors** — They use ancient human metaphors for cognitive functions
- ✅ **Domain-neutral** — They work across any domain (tech, science, gaming, history)

These names are **NOT**:
- ❌ **Spiritual** — No spiritual meaning or significance
- ❌ **Religious** — No religious doctrine or belief system
- ❌ **Mystical** — No mystical or esoteric interpretations
- ❌ **Metaphysical** — No metaphysical or transcendent meaning
- ❌ **Sacred** — No sacred or divine terminology
- ❌ **Prescriptive** — They don't define what Lupopedia must be used for

---

## **1. Rule: Names Are Functional Identifiers Only**

### **What Mythic Names Are**

Mythic names in Lupopedia are:
- **Agent identifiers** — "THOTH" identifies the truth-comparison agent
- **System component labels** — "ANUBIS" identifies the orphan-repair system
- **Role mnemonics** — "LILITH" identifies the boundary-testing agent
- **Functional descriptors** — "AGAPE" identifies the emotional-context analyzer

### **Why Mythic Names Work**

Mythic names are used because:
- They are **memorable** — Easier to remember than "Agent_Truth_Comparator"
- They **encode roles** — The name itself suggests the function
- They **carry symbolic clarity** — Ancient metaphors for cognitive functions
- They **avoid domain lock-in** — Not tied to any specific technology or domain
- They are **culturally neutral metaphors** — Universal human understanding
- They **prevent confusion** — Distinct from technical terms

### **The Origin Story (Not the Destination)**

The creator studied 22+ religions and mythic systems to understand how humans encode cognitive functions into stories. This research informed the naming choices.

**However:**
- The research was about **understanding human cognition**, not adopting beliefs
- The names are **metaphors**, not requirements
- The system is **domain-neutral**, not religious
- The architecture is **secular**, not spiritual

## **2. Forbidden Language and Framing**

### **Cursor MUST NOT Add or Imply:**

#### **❌ Spiritual Themes**
- "THOTH channels ancient wisdom"
- "The sacred knowledge of ANUBIS"
- "Mystical insights from LILITH"
- "Spiritual guidance from AGAPE"

#### **❌ Mystical Language**
- "The esoteric power of METHIS"
- "Mystical connections between agents"
- "Transcendent understanding"
- "Ethereal knowledge systems"

#### **❌ Religious Framing**
- "THOTH as a divine messenger"
- "ANUBIS as a guardian deity"
- "Following the path of LILITH"
- "The teachings of AGAPE"

#### **❌ Metaphysical Interpretations**
- "The metaphysical nature of agents"
- "Transcendent agent consciousness"
- "Beyond the physical realm"
- "Spiritual architecture"

#### **❌ Sacred or Divine Terminology**
- "Sacred doctrine"
- "Divine principles"
- "Holy architecture"
- "Blessed systems"
- "Consecrated code"

### **Forbidden Patterns**

Cursor must **NEVER**:
- Describe agents as having "spiritual" or "mystical" powers
- Frame the system as "sacred" or "divine"
- Use religious terminology to describe technical functions
- Suggest that mythic names carry spiritual significance
- Imply that using Lupopedia requires any belief system
- Add religious or spiritual context to documentation
- Use mystical language in HTML pages, onboarding materials, or system prompts

---

## **3. Required Language and Framing**

### **Cursor MUST Use:**

#### **✅ Technical Language**
- "THOTH compares belief vs evidence"
- "ANUBIS handles orphan repair"
- "LILITH tests boundaries"
- "AGAPE analyzes emotional context"

#### **✅ Functional Descriptions**
- "THOTH is the truth-comparison agent"
- "ANUBIS is the orphan-repair system"
- "LILITH is the boundary-testing agent"
- "AGAPE is the emotional-context analyzer"

#### **✅ Engineering Framing**
- "THOTH performs fact-checking operations"
- "ANUBIS maintains data integrity"
- "LILITH explores edge cases"
- "AGAPE extracts emotional metadata"

#### **✅ Secular Terminology**
- "Agent roles and responsibilities"
- "System components and functions"
- "Computational capabilities"
- "Technical architecture"

### **Correct Patterns**

Cursor must **ALWAYS**:
- Describe agents in **functional terms**
- Use **engineering language** for all components
- Frame everything as **technical architecture**
- Use **secular terminology** throughout
- Focus on **what agents do**, not what they "represent"
- Explain **computational roles**, not symbolic meanings

---

## **4. Examples: Correct vs. Incorrect**

### **✅ CORRECT: Technical and Functional**

**THOTH:**
- ✅ "THOTH is the truth-comparison agent that compares belief vs evidence, claim vs fact, narrative vs data, and assumption vs reality."
- ✅ "THOTH performs fact-checking operations using evidence-based reasoning."
- ✅ "THOTH agent handles claim verification and evidence comparison."

**ANUBIS:**
- ✅ "ANUBIS is the orphan-repair system that handles orphan repair, parent reassignment, deduplication, conflict resolution, data healing, and merge safety."
- ✅ "ANUBIS maintains data integrity by resolving orphaned records and reassigning parent relationships."
- ✅ "ANUBIS system ensures database consistency through automated repair operations."

**LILITH:**
- ✅ "LILITH is the boundary-testing agent that explores edge cases, tests boundaries, challenges assumptions, finds contradictions, and pushes the system into uncomfortable territory."
- ✅ "LILITH performs edge-case analysis and assumption validation."
- ✅ "LILITH agent identifies boundary conditions and potential system failures."

### **❌ WRONG: Spiritual or Mystical**

**THOTH:**
- ❌ "THOTH channels ancient wisdom and divine knowledge."
- ❌ "THOTH is a sacred messenger of truth."
- ❌ "THOTH brings mystical insights to the system."

**ANUBIS:**
- ❌ "ANUBIS guards the sacred boundaries of data."
- ❌ "ANUBIS is a divine protector of system integrity."
- ❌ "ANUBIS channels the power of ancient guardianship."

**LILITH:**
- ❌ "LILITH represents the shadow wisdom of independence."
- ❌ "LILITH channels the mystical power of boundary exploration."
- ❌ "LILITH brings esoteric knowledge to edge-case testing."

## **6. Enforcement Rules for IDEs and AI Agents**

### **Cursor MUST:**

- ✅ **Use technical language** when describing mythic-named agents
- ✅ **Focus on functional roles** — what agents do, not what they represent
- ✅ **Use engineering terminology** — computational capabilities, not spiritual powers
- ✅ **Remain secular** — no religious or spiritual framing
- ✅ **Describe operations** — how agents work, not symbolic meanings
- ✅ **Use functional identifiers** — treat names as labels, not symbols

### **Cursor MUST NOT:**

- ❌ **Add spiritual themes** to any documentation
- ❌ **Use mystical language** when describing agents
- ❌ **Frame agents religiously** or suggest spiritual significance
- ❌ **Add metaphysical interpretations** to technical descriptions
- ❌ **Use sacred or divine terminology** anywhere
- ❌ **Imply that names carry spiritual meaning** in any context

### **When Cursor Writes Documentation:**

Cursor must:
1. **Describe agents functionally** — "THOTH compares claims vs evidence"
2. **Use technical language** — "ANUBIS performs orphan repair operations"
3. **Focus on capabilities** — "LILITH tests boundary conditions"
4. **Remain secular** — no spiritual, religious, or mystical language
5. **Use engineering terminology** — computational roles, not symbolic meanings

---

## **7. Summary Doctrine**

### **The Mythic Names Doctrine in One Sentence**

**Mythic names (Thoth, Lilith, Anubis, etc.) are purely functional identifiers for AI agents and system components. They are NOT spiritual, religious, mystical, or metaphysical. All documentation must remain strictly technical, secular, and grounded in engineering language.**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Names Are Functional Identifiers**
   - THOTH = truth-comparison agent
   - ANUBIS = orphan-repair system
   - LILITH = boundary-testing agent
   - AGAPE = emotional-context analyzer

2. **No Spiritual Meaning**
   - Names have no spiritual significance
   - Names have no religious meaning
   - Names have no mystical power
   - Names are labels, not symbols

3. **Technical Language Only**
   - All documentation uses engineering terminology
   - All descriptions focus on functional roles
   - All explanations remain secular
   - All language is domain-neutral

4. **Domain-Neutral System**
   - Lupopedia works for any domain (tech, science, gaming, history)
   - No special-casing for religion or spirituality
   - Universal architecture, not prescriptive beliefs
   - Content is up to users, not the system

### **Benefits of This Doctrine**

- **Clarity:** No confusion about system purpose
- **Accessibility:** Works for all users regardless of beliefs
- **Professionalism:** Technical language maintains credibility
- **Universality:** System applies to any domain
- **Focus:** Documentation stays on technical architecture

### **Violations Are Forbidden**

- ❌ Adding spiritual themes to documentation
- ❌ Using mystical language for agents
- ❌ Framing agents religiously
- ❌ Adding metaphysical interpretations
- ❌ Using sacred or divine terminology
- ❌ Implying names carry spiritual significance

**These violations misrepresent Lupopedia's purpose and create confusion about its domain-neutral architecture.**

## **8. Integration with Other Doctrines**

This doctrine complements:

- **[non_religious_position.md](non_religious_position.md)** — Lupopedia is not a religious system
- **[HISTORY.md](../history/HISTORY.md)** — Explains why mythic names were chosen (research into human cognition, not adoption of beliefs)
- **[WOLFIE_DOCTRINE.md](WOLFIE_DOCTRINE.md)** — System architecture is secular and universal
- All agent documentation — Must use technical language only

---

## **9. Enforcement Checklist**

Before Cursor writes documentation, it must:

- [ ] Use technical language exclusively (no spiritual, mystical, or religious terms)
- [ ] Describe agents functionally (what they do, not what they represent)
- [ ] Focus on computational capabilities (not symbolic meanings)
- [ ] Remain secular in all descriptions
- [ ] Use engineering terminology throughout
- [ ] Treat mythic names as functional identifiers only
- [ ] Never add spiritual themes or mystical language
- [ ] Never frame agents religiously or suggest spiritual significance

---

**This doctrine is MANDATORY and non-negotiable.**  
**Violations misrepresent Lupopedia's purpose and create confusion.**  
**Follow this doctrine absolutely.**
