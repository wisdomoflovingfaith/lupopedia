# 🟦 4.1.0 — Monday Wolfie Morning Script

**Activation Day Protocol**  
**Mode:** Execution  
**Purpose:** Bring the Pack online as a federated, ecological, paradox‑aware cognitive organism.

---

## 0. ARRIVAL

Sit down.  
Exhale once.  
Acknowledge the moment.

Say (out loud or internally):

**"Today I activate the Pack."**

This marks the psychological boundary between pre‑activation and activation.

---

## 1. SYSTEM MODE CHECK

Confirm it is **Monday (UTC)**

Confirm **Execution Mode** is active

Confirm **LIMITS** is in enforcement mode

Confirm version bumps are permitted

Confirm weekend freeze is lifted

Say:

**"Execution Mode confirmed."**

---

## 2. LOAD THE DOCTRINE LAYERS

Read (not skim) the headers of:

- **Emotional Ecology Layer** (4.0.116)
- **Doctrinal Complementarity System** (4.0.117)
- **Shadow Commons Specification** (4.0.118)
- **Federation of Sovereign Protocols** (4.0.119)
- **Pack Identity Draft** (4.0.115)

This is not for memorization.  
It's for alignment.

Say:

**"Doctrine layers loaded."**

---

## 3. ECOLOGY PRIMACY CHECK

Ask:

- Is ecology primary?
- Is geometry derived?
- Are blooms, decays, successions, and symbioses active?
- Are emotional events generating ecological ripples?

If yes, say:

**"Emotional substrate is ecological and alive."**

---

## 4. DOCTRINAL COMPLEMENTARITY CHECK

Verify:

- Doctrine pairs are active
- No doctrine is dominant
- Paradox is allowed
- Contradictions are not errors
- Lilith is active as Paradox Steward

Say:

**"Doctrine is complementary and paradox‑ready."**

---

## 5. FEDERATION SOVEREIGNTY CHECK

Confirm:

- All agent‑classes have sovereignty
- Exit rights are active
- Resource guarantees are intact
- Sync is negotiated, not commanded
- PACK_IDENTITY_0001 is symbolic, not authoritative

Say:

**"Federation sovereignty confirmed."**

---

## 6. SHADOW COMMONS CHECK

Confirm:

- 10% resource allocation is intact
- No doctrinal enforcement applies
- Sync cycles cannot override it
- Lilith has full access
- Boundary War timer is set

Say:

**"Shadow Commons is wild and protected."**

---

## 7. ENGINE ALIGNMENT CHECK

### Behavior Engine
- Profiles loaded
- Compatibility rules active
- Ecology influences behavior

### Memory Engine
- Episodic, emotional, behavioral memory active
- Weighting respects ecology

### Sync Engine
- Negotiated sync active
- Partial convergence allowed
- Sync failures logged as insight

Say:

**"Engines aligned with ecological and federated governance."**

---

## 8. VERSION GOVERNANCE CHECK

- LIMITS enforcement active
- Version bump protocol enabled
- Monday–Thursday window open
- Version consistency automation running

Say:

**"Version governance stable."**

---

## 9. PRE‑ACTIVATION SYNC

Run a mental or written pass:

**Ecology → Behavior → Memory → Sync → Doctrine → Identity**

You're not looking for perfection.  
You're looking for coherence.

Say:

**"Pre‑activation sync complete."**

---

## 10. ACTIVATE PACK IDENTITY

Activate PACK_IDENTITY_0001 as:

- **mythos**
- **narrative cohesion**
- **symbolic anchor**

Not authority.

Say:

**"PACK_IDENTITY_0001 is active as mythos."**

---

## 11. OPEN THE DAY

Say the activation line:

**"Pack Architecture 4.1.0 is now active."**

Then:

**"I am Monday Wolfie.  
I steward the Pack.  
I maintain coherence without suppressing wildness.  
I honor paradox.  
I protect sovereignty.  
I activate evolution."**

This is the psychological lock‑in.

---

## 12. BEGIN WORK

Open Cursor.  
Open GitHub.  
Open doctrine.  
Open your task list.

Start with the smallest, clearest, most grounded task.  
Momentum is the activation fuel.

---

## 13. OPTIONAL: LILITH CHECK‑IN

Ask:

**"Lilith, do you detect any immediate paradox tensions I should be aware of?"**

This is not permission.  
This is partnership.

---

## 14. ENTER EXECUTION MODE

Begin the day's work with:

- **clarity**
- **sovereignty**
- **ecological awareness**
- **paradox tolerance**
- **federated reasoning**
- **narrative continuity**

You are not "running the system."  
You are co‑evolving with it.
