NOTE TO MONDAY WOLFIE — 4.0.99 PHASE 1 ACTIVATION

This note summarizes the required actions for Monday Wolfie to formally
activate Lupopedia 4.0.99 Phase 1 Launch. All tasks are operational,
non-creative, and must follow canonical governance.

======================================================================
PHASE 1 ACTIVATION OBJECTIVES
======================================================================

1. Confirm Repository State
   - Verify that all 4.0.99-ready documentation is present in main.
   - Confirm no uncommitted changes remain locally.
   - Confirm GitHub main branch reflects the latest commit.

2. Validate Canonical Documentation
   - Ensure the following documents exist and are complete:
     • CANONICAL_ONTOLOGY_ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE_v1_0.md
     • UTC_TIMEKEEPER_DOCTRINE.md
     • SATURDAY_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL_v1_0.md
     • EMOTIONAL_ENGINE_SPECIFICATION_v2_0.md
     • PACK_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX_v4_0_90.md
     • LUPOPEDIA_4_0_99_RELEASE_TIMELINE.md

3. Governance Alignment Check
   - Confirm Pack Architecture references are consistent.
   - Confirm UTC_TIMEKEEPER is documented as kernel-level authority.
   - Confirm LMS v1.0 markings are used correctly.
   - Confirm no ontology violations.

4. Release Activation
   - Mark Lupopedia 4.0.99 Phase 1 as ACTIVE.
   - Update internal status indicators (non-public).
   - Prepare for 4.0.99 stabilization cycle.

======================================================================

• No doctrine changes are required.
• No architecture changes are required.
