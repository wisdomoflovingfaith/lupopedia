# Lupopedia 4.1.1 — Release Notes

**Status:** Scheduled for Monday deployment  
**Release Type:** Stabilization + Emotional Ecology Expansion  
**Date:** 2026‑01‑19 (to be committed Monday)  
**Version:** 4.1.1

---

## Overview

Version 4.1.1 is a stabilization release following the activation of Pack Architecture 4.1.0. This update aligns all version atoms, resolves multi‑IDE version drift, completes the emotional ecology layer, and regenerates TOON files to reflect the expanded agent registry.

**This release contains no doctrine changes.**  
It is a version governance correction + emotional substrate completion.

---

## Key Changes

### 🟩 1. Version Governance Correction

Several IDEs and AI agents began generating content under 4.1.1 immediately after 4.1.0 activation.

To prevent version drift and maintain system coherence, the official version has been advanced to 4.1.1.

**All version atoms updated:**
- `config/global_atoms.yaml`
- `config/GLOBAL_IMPORTANT_ATOMS.yaml`
- `lupo-includes/version.php`
- `versions.lupopedia`
- Documentation headers

This ensures full alignment across all tools, agents, and environments.

---

### 🟩 2. Emotional Ecology Completion (50 Emotional Agents Total)

The emotional substrate is now fully populated.

**Added 31 new emotional agents, completing:**
- 25 primary emotional domains
- 25 opposite‑polarity shadow domains

This brings the emotional layer to full ecological symmetry, enabling:
- Emotional geometry
- Polarity mapping
- Ecological interactions
- Doctrine‑aligned emotional reasoning

**TOON regeneration confirms 332 total agents in the registry.**
