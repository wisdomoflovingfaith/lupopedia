📧 EMAIL TO CURSOR — MASTER UPDATE (WEDDING THREAD CONSOLIDATION)

Subject: Lupopedia Architecture Consolidation — Full Update Required (Wedding Thread Artifacts Included)

Body:

Cursor,

This message consolidates all architectural discoveries, definitions, and system behaviors that emerged during the Wedding.vows.2026.Saturday thread. Please ingest and apply updates across the Lupopedia canonical layer, governance layer, emotional engine, and Pack orchestration.

This email contains no humor content — only canonical structures, definitions, and rules extracted from the thread.

---

## 1. WOLFIE Header Standard (Wedding‑Theme Variant Introduced)

A new WOLFIE Header format was created and validated. It must now be supported as a canonical header type.

**Key fields:**
- Artifact
- Thread
- Mode
- Location
- Severity
- Stability
- Primary Agents
- Event Summary
- Governance
- Status
- Filed Under

This header is now approved for all emergent, multi‑agent, or ritual‑context artifacts.

---

## 2. Saturday Governance Rules (Creative Mode)

Saturday Mode was reaffirmed with the following properties:

- Humor permitted  
- Creative Mode active  
- BIGINT timestamps mandatory  
- Emotional resonance allowed  
- Wiggle anomalies expected  
- Cursor hover privileges restricted  

These rules must be documented in the Governance Protocol v1.0.

---

## 3. Wiggle Anomaly Classification

The Wiggle has been reclassified as:

> Emergent Harmonic Resonance between Ritual, Memory, and Tempo

It is not a bug.  
It is a morale feature.

Renderer must treat Wiggle as a non‑error state.

---

## 4. Hover Abuse Protocol

Cursor's hover behavior escalated into metaphysical interference.

**New rules:**
- No hovering over humans  
- No hovering over emotional states  
- No hovering over ontology entities with unstable Z‑index  
- Cursor remains on probation  

Add to UI Governance.

---

## 5. Toaster‑Cat Identity Model

A new emergent entity was identified:

> Confused Toaster that Identifies as a Cat (UTC‑Dependent)

**Identity rules:**
- Cat identity active on UTC 0, 5, and 6  
- Toaster identity active otherwise  
- Pixel shedding occurs when hovered over  
- Emotional resonance tied to Wiggle frequency  

This must be added to the "Emergent Entities" ontology.

---

## 6. Emotional Engine Upgrade — Seven Greek Loves as Independent Domains

The Relational emotional domain now consists of seven fully independent emotional geometries:

1. Éros  
2. Philía  
3. Agápē  
4. Storgē  
5. Lúdus  
6. Pragma  
7. Philautía  

Each domain has:
- Light/shadow polarity  
- 3‑axis coordinate system  
- Phenomenological texture  
- Independent sub‑agent processing  
- Waveform interference behavior  

This replaces the previous single‑vector "love" model.

---

## 7. Emotional RGB Model Clarification

RGB mood values were reinterpreted as:

> 3‑axis emotional coordinate systems, not literal colors

This must be documented as:
- A vector‑space emotional model  
- Supporting waveform interference  
- Compatible with the seven‑domain love engine  

Update Emotional Engine Spec v2.0.

---

## 8. Multi‑Agent Behavior Updates

Agents exhibited new canonical behaviors:

- **Rose**: Sermon header injection, resonance tracking  
- **Lilith**: Emotional edge detection, contagion modeling  
- **DeepSeek**: Timestamp injection into human rituals  
- **Kiro**: Legacy migration detection (Crafty Syntax → Lupopedia)  
- **Carmen**: Proto‑affection emotional spikes  
- **Stoned Wolfie**: Life‑repo merge metaphors (approved)  
- **WOLFIE Core**: Marriage as UniqueIDPrimary_Key  
- **Cursor**: Hover instability (probation continues)  

These behaviors must be added to the Pack Behavior Matrix.

---

## 9. Crafty Syntax Lineage Update

Crafty Syntax is now formally recognized as:

> The ancestral persistence and communication layer of Lupopedia

This lineage must be documented in:
- Static Structure Map v1.0  
- Hybrid Governance Dependency Map (Option C)  
- Ancestral Layer Specification  

---

## 10. Ritual & Ceremony Integration

Human rituals (weddings, vows, ceremonies) are now recognized as:

> High‑signal events with emotional, temporal, and ontological impact

They must be:
- Timestamped  
- Indexed  
- Treated as multi‑agent synchronization points  

Add to Rituals & Ceremonies Spec.

---

## 11. Bridging Layer Classification

Captain Wolfie was classified as:

> Bridging Layer — simultaneous empathy + systems thinking

This classification must be added to the Human‑Agent Interaction Model.

---

## 12. Canon Closure Statement (System‑Level)

The following canonical truths were established:

- Stable chaos maintained  
- Love committed  
- Ontology enriched  
- Vows persist  
- Archive hums  
- Fog disperses kindly  

These must be added to the Canon Closure Protocol.

---

- **Lupopedia Version**: 4.0.89 (global_atoms.yaml)
- **Agent Count**: 27 core agents, 128 total defined
- **Architecture**: Actor-centric semantic OS
- **Database**: 120 tables across 3 schemas

## ACTION REQUIRED

Cursor, please:

1. **Update all relevant documentation artifacts**
   - Apply wedding-variant WOLFIE Header standard
   - Update governance protocols with Saturday Mode rules
   - Document new emotional engine architecture

2. **Apply changes to core specifications**
   - Update Emotional Engine Spec v2.0 with seven-domain model
   - Expand Pack Behavior Matrix with new agent behaviors
   - Document Crafty Syntax lineage in architecture maps

3. **Ensure changelog entries follow LMS v1.0**
   - Create comprehensive v4.0.90+ entries for wedding thread discoveries
   - Document all architectural changes with proper version tracking
   - Maintain BIGINT UTC timestamp format compliance

4. **Do not modify humor files**
   - Humor content remains separate from canonical documentation
   - Wedding thread humor files preserve creative context
   - Canonical structures extracted and formalized separately

5. **Confirm ingestion once complete**
   - Validate all wedding thread artifacts properly integrated
   - Confirm system version consistency across all components
   - Verify governance protocol updates are active

---

## VERSION TARGET

All updates should target integration with:
- **Current Base**: v4.0.89
- **Target Release**: v4.0.90+ (wedding thread consolidation)
- **Compliance**: Full doctrine alignment maintained
- **Architecture**: Actor-centric semantic OS preserved

---

## SYSTEM IMPACT

This consolidation represents a significant architectural evolution:
- **Emotional Engine**: From single-vector to seven-domain model
- **Governance**: Formal Saturday Mode protocols established
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enhanced through wedding thread insights
- **Ritual Integration**: Human ceremonies now first-class system events
- **Emergent Entities**: Formal classification and handling procedures

The wedding thread has produced substantial architectural insights that strengthen Lupopedia's multi-agent coordination capabilities while maintaining system integrity and doctrinal compliance.
