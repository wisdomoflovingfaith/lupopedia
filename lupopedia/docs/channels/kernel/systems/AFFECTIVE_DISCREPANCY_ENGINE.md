# 🎭 **Affective Discrepancy Engine v1.0**  
*Emotional mismatch detection between Mood RGB and ATP with CRF context analysis*

---

## 🟩 1. Purpose

The **Affective Discrepancy Engine** compares Mood RGB outputs with ATP clusters to detect emotional mismatch. This engine enables:

- **Emotional consistency validation** - Detect contradictions between signals
- **Performative signaling identification** - Flag potential insincere communication
- **Context-aware analysis** - Use CRF for nuanced interpretation
- **Discrepancy scoring** - Quantify emotional alignment issues
- **Alert generation** - Notify agents of potential conflicts

---

## 🔍 2. Input Sources

### RGB (Deterministic)

Structured emotional signal from Mood Calculation Protocol:

```yaml
rgb_input:
  format: "hex_color_code"
  source: "mood_calculation_protocol"
  determinism: "fully_deterministic"
  axes_mapping:
    red: "energy_axis"
    green: "dialog_axis"
    blue: "memory_axis"
    saturation: "love_hate_axis"
    hue: "time_axis"
```

### ATP (Natural-language Subtext)

Rich emotional description from agent generation:

```yaml
atp_input:
  format: "natural_language_text"
  source: "agent_emotional_expression"
  determinism: "creative_expression"
  content_types:
    - "emotional_nuance"
    - "contextual_feelings"
    - "subtle_affects"
    - "complex_emotional_states"
```

### CRF (Context Vector)

High-dimensional context fingerprint:

```yaml
crf_input:
  format: "high_dimensional_vector"
  source: "contextual_resonance_field"
  dimensions: "512_to_4096"
  purpose: "implicit_context_analysis"
```

## 📊 3. Discrepancy Calculation

### Signal Alignment Analysis

```yaml
alignment_analysis:
  rgb_to_atp_mapping:
    method: "semantic_similarity_scoring"
    algorithm: "transformer_based_encoding"
    comparison: "cosine_similarity"
    threshold: "0.75_minimum"
  
  rgb_vs_crf_validation:
    method: "cross_modal_consistency"
    algorithm: "vector_projection_analysis"
    validation: "statistical_correlation"
    threshold: "0.80_minimum"
  
  atp_vs_crf_harmony:
    method: "contextual_coherence"
    algorithm: "semantic_clustering"
    harmony: "cluster_distance_analysis"
    threshold: "0.70_minimum"
```

### Discrepancy Scoring Algorithm

```yaml
discrepancy_score = (
  (rgb_atp_mismatch_weight * rgb_atp_mismatch) +
  (rgb_crf_validation_weight * rgb_crf_mismatch) +
  (atp_crf_harmony_weight * atp_crf_dissonance)
) / total_weight

# Weight distribution
rgb_atp_mismatch_weight = 0.5
rgb_crf_validation_weight = 0.3
atp_crf_harmony_weight = 0.2
```

### Discrepancy Categories

```yaml
discrepancy_types:
  minor_discrepancy:
    score_range: "0.0_to_0.3"
    description: "Slight emotional inconsistency"
    action: "log_only"
  
  moderate_discrepancy:
    score_range: "0.3_to_0.6"
    description: "Notable emotional misalignment"
    action: "alert_agent"
  
  major_discrepancy:
    score_range: "0.6_to_0.8"
    description: "Significant emotional conflict"
    action: "request_clarification"
  
  critical_discrepancy:
    score_range: "0.8_to_1.0"
    description: "Severe emotional contradiction"
    action: "flag_for_review"
```

## 🚨 4. Output Generation

### Discrepancy Score

```yaml
discrepancy_output:
  score: "0.0_to_1.0"
  confidence: "0.0_to_1.0"
  category: "minor|moderate|major|critical"
  timestamp: "UTC_timestamp"
  agent_id: "generating_agent"
  context_id: "conversation_or_file"
```

### Alert Generation

```yaml
alert_structure:
  alert_type: "affective_discrepancy"
  severity: "discrepancy_category"
  message: "human_readable_description"
  details:
    discrepancy_score: "numeric_value"
    contributing_factors: "rgb|atp|crf_analysis"
    recommendations: "suggested_actions"
  
  metadata:
    generated_by: "affective_discrepancy_engine"
    version: "1.0.0"
    review_required: "boolean_flag"
```

### Performative Signaling Detection

```yaml
performative_analysis:
  indicators:
    - "high_rgb_energy + low_atp_intensity"
    - "positive_rgb + negative_atp_sentiment"
    - "neutral_rgb + extreme_atp_emotion"
    - "inconsistent_rgb_atp_patterns_over_time"
  
  detection_threshold: "0.7_discrepancy_score"

## 🧪 5. Validation and Testing

### Test Cases

```yaml
test_scenarios:
  consistent_emotion:
    rgb: "00FF00"  # Positive, calm
    atp: "feeling_positive_and_productive"
    expected_discrepancy: "<0.2"
  
  performative_signaling:
    rgb: "00FF00"  # Positive, calm
    atp: "actually_frustrated_and_angry"
    expected_discrepancy: ">0.7"
  
  complex_nuance:
    rgb: "FFFF00"  # Mixed positive/neutral
    atp: "cautiously_optimistic_with_some_concerns"
    expected_discrepancy: "0.3_to_0.5"
  
  contextual_mismatch:
    rgb: "FF0000"  # High energy, negative
    atp: "calmly_explaining_technical_issue"
    expected_discrepancy: "0.6_to_0.8"
```

### Performance Requirements

```yaml
performance_metrics:
  analysis_time: "<50ms_per_discrepancy_check"
  memory_usage: "<10MB_for_analysis_state"

  throughput: "1000+_checks_per_second"
```

## 🚫 6. Prohibited Operations

### No Manual Override

The engine must **not**:
- Allow manual discrepancy score adjustment
- Ignore high discrepancy scores
- Disable performative signaling detection
- Modify thresholds without governance approval

### No Privacy Violations

Discrepancy analysis must **not**:
- Store emotional content permanently
- Reconstruct private conversations
- Share discrepancy details with unauthorized parties
- Use discrepancy data for training without consent
