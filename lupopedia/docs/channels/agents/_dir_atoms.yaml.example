# Example Directory Atoms File
# Copy this to any directory as _dir_atoms.yaml
# 
# Purpose: Define directory-scoped constants for files in this directory
#
# Rules:
# - DIR_* atoms apply only to files in THIS directory (non-recursive)
# - DIRR_* atoms apply to files in THIS directory AND all descendant directories (recursive)
# - For DIRR_* resolution, walk up parent directories until _dir_atoms.yaml is found
# - Cursor MUST preserve symbolic references, not expand them

# Directory-only atoms (non-recursive)
# These apply ONLY to files in the current directory
DIR_DOCS_AUTHOR: "Documentation Team"
DIR_DOCS_CHANNEL: "docs"

# Directory-recursive atoms (inherited by descendants)
# These apply to files in this directory AND all subdirectories
DIRR_DOCS_VERSION: "4.0.1"
DIRR_DOCS_COLLECTION: "core-docs"
DIRR_DOCS_STATUS: "published"

# Example: If this file is at docs/agents/_dir_atoms.yaml
# - DIR_DOCS_AUTHOR applies only to files in docs/agents/
# - DIRR_DOCS_VERSION applies to files in docs/agents/ AND docs/agents/subdir/ AND docs/agents/subdir/nested/
