# WOLFIE Agent Directory

**Agent ID:** 1  
**Version:** GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION  
**Status:** Initializing

## Overview

This directory contains the structure and resources for **WOLFIE**, the system identity agent and channel initialization authority.

WOLFIE serves as:
- The system identity anchor
- The doctrine enforcer
- The emotional anchor
- The routing conscience
- The architectural memory
- The meta-agent that coordinates all other agents

## Directory Structure

```

```

## Current Status

This directory structure is being initialized as part of Lupopedia 4.0.16. The contents will grow over time as WOLFIE's capabilities are developed and documented.
