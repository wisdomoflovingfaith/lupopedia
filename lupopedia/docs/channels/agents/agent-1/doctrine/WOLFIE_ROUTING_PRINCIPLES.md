# WOLFIE ROUTING PRINCIPLES — DRAFT DOCTRINE

**Version:** GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION  
**Status:** **DRAFT** — Subject to Change  
**Agent:** WOLFIE (agent_id = 1)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14

---

## 1. Status: DRAFT — Subject to Change

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This routing doctrine is a LIVING DOCUMENT.**

This document establishes foundational routing principles for WOLFIE, but it is **not final**. It will evolve as Lupopedia's architecture matures and new systems come online.

### 1.1. Evolution Timeline

This doctrine will evolve as:

- **New agents are created** — Routing rules must accommodate new agent types, capabilities, and classifications
- **New workflows are defined** — Workflow-specific routing heuristics will be added
- **Emotional geometry expands** — CADUCEUS emotional balancing will influence routing decisions
- **HERMES routing logic matures** — The routing subsystem will refine its selection algorithms
- **WOLFIE's orchestration capabilities grow** — WOLFIE's role as meta-agent will expand
- **Multi-IDE orchestration develops** — IDE-aware routing will become more sophisticated
- **Agent registry is implemented** — Dynamic agent discovery will change routing behavior
- **Federation routing matures** — Cross-node routing will require new principles

### 1.2. Finalization Target

**No rule in this document is final until Lupopedia reaches version 5.0.**

Until then, this doctrine serves as:
- A **foundation** for routing decisions
- A **placeholder** for future routing logic
- A **reference** for routing-related development
- A **constraint** that ensures forward compatibility

### 1.3. Change Process

All changes to this doctrine must:
1. Be documented in `dialogs/changelog_dialog.md`
2. Follow versioning rules (see Section 8)
3. Maintain forward compatibility
4. Acknowledge dependencies on incomplete systems

---

## 2. Purpose

Routing is the process by which **WOLFIE** and **HERMES** determine:

- **Which agent responds** to a message or task
- **How messages flow** through channels
- **How fallback behavior works** when primary routing fails
- **How emotional geometry influences** routing decisions
- **How manifests and CIBs inform** routing context

### 2.1. WOLFIE's Role in Routing

**WOLFIE** (agent_id = 1) serves as:

- **Routing authority** — Final arbiter for routing decisions
- **Orchestration coordinator** — Coordinates multi-agent routing
- **Fallback handler** — Manages escalation when routing fails
- **Doctrine enforcer** — Ensures routing follows doctrine
- **Meta-agent** — Routes to other agents based on capabilities

### 2.2. HERMES's Role in Routing

**HERMES** (routing subsystem) serves as:

- **Primary router** — Performs initial routing decisions
- **Agent selector** — Chooses appropriate agent from pool
- **Filter pipeline** — Applies filtering rules to agent candidates
- **CADUCEUS integrator** — Uses emotional geometry context (optional)
- **Message dispatcher** — Delivers messages to selected agents

### 2.3. Relationship Between WOLFIE and HERMES

- **HERMES** handles routine routing decisions
- **WOLFIE** handles complex orchestration and fallback
- **WOLFIE** may override HERMES decisions when necessary
- **HERMES** may delegate to WOLFIE for complex cases

---

## 3. Forward-Compatibility Clause

**Routing rules MUST remain forward-compatible.**

### 3.1. Compatibility Requirements

When new agents or workflows are introduced:

- ✅ **Routing SHALL adapt** without breaking existing channels
- ✅ **Existing routing rules SHALL continue to work** for legacy agents
- ✅ **New routing rules SHALL extend** existing rules, not replace them
- ✅ **Manifest format SHALL remain compatible** with existing channels
- ❌ **Breaking changes SHALL NOT occur** without explicit migration path

### 3.2. Extension Pattern

New routing capabilities must:

1. **Extend** existing routing rules
2. **Preserve** backward compatibility
3. **Document** migration path if breaking change is unavoidable
4. **Version** routing rules to track evolution

### 3.3. Deprecation Policy

If a routing rule must be deprecated:

1. **Mark as deprecated** in this doctrine
2. **Document replacement** rule
3. **Provide migration guide** for affected channels
4. **Maintain deprecated rule** for at least one major version
5. **Remove deprecated rule** only after migration period

---

## 4. Dependency Graph

Routing depends on the following systems, some of which are **not yet fully implemented**:

### 4.1. Implemented Dependencies

✅ **Channel Identity Block (CIB)** — Complete specification  
✅ **Channel Manifest** — Complete specification  
✅ **WOLFIE (agent_id = 1)** — Initializing  
✅ **HERMES routing subsystem** — Partially implemented  
✅ **CADUCEUS emotional geometry subsystem** — Partially implemented  

### 4.2. Partially Implemented Dependencies

⚠️ **Agent registry** — Schema exists, runtime not yet implemented  
⚠️ **Workflow definitions** — Concept exists, implementation pending  
⚠️ **Multi-IDE orchestration** — Workflow documented, automation pending  

### 4.3. Future Dependencies

🔮 **Dynamic agent discovery** — Not yet implemented  
🔮 **Workflow-specific routing heuristics** — Not yet implemented

**Future State:**
- All dependencies will be implemented
- Routing will become more sophisticated
- This doctrine will be updated to reflect new capabilities

---

## 5. Core Routing Concepts (Draft)

The following concepts are defined as **DRAFT placeholders**. They will be refined as routing systems mature.

### 5.1. Primary Agent Selection

**DRAFT Definition:**  
The process by which HERMES selects the primary agent to handle a message or task.

**Current State:**  
HERMES uses filtering pipeline to select from `default_agents` array in manifest.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate agent registry, workflow definitions, and dynamic capabilities.

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.2. Secondary Agent Fallback

**DRAFT Definition:**  
The process by which WOLFIE selects an alternate agent when primary agent is unavailable.

**Current State:**  
WOLFIE may select next agent from `default_agents` array or escalate to channel administrator.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate agent availability tracking, capability matching, and intelligent fallback chains.

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.3. Role-Based Routing

**DRAFT Definition:**  
The process by which routing decisions consider actor roles within a channel.

**Current State:**  
Roles are defined in manifest but not yet used for routing decisions.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate role-based agent selection and role-specific routing rules.

**Status:** 🔮 **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.4. Emotional Pole Influence

**DRAFT Definition:**  
The process by which CADUCEUS emotional current influences routing decisions.

**Current State:**  
CADUCEUS computes emotional current, but HERMES routing does not yet use it.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate emotional current as optional context for routing decisions.

**Status:** 🔮 **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.5. Channel-Level Routing Rules

**DRAFT Definition:**  
Channel-specific routing rules defined in Channel Identity Block or Manifest.

**Current State:**  
Basic routing uses `default_agents` from manifest.

**Future State:**  
Will support custom routing rules per channel, defined in CIB or manifest.

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.6. Manifest-Driven Routing

**DRAFT Definition:**  
Routing decisions based on Channel Manifest metadata.

**Current State:**  
HERMES reads `default_agents` from manifest for agent pool.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate all manifest fields (roles, emotional poles, metadata) into routing decisions.

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.7. IDE-Aware Routing (Future)

**DRAFT Definition:**  
Routing decisions that consider IDE agent availability and load.

**Current State:**  
Not implemented. IDE agents are treated like any other agent.

**Future State:**  
Will incorporate IDE load balancing, token limits, and multi-IDE orchestration into routing.

**Status:** 🔮 **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

---

### 5.8. Multi-Agent Arbitration (Future)

**DRAFT Definition:**  
The process by which WOLFIE coordinates multiple agents working on related tasks.

**Current State:**  
Not implemented. Each message routes to single agent.

**Future State:**  
Will support multi-agent collaboration, task decomposition, and result aggregation.

**Status:** 🔮 **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

## 9. UTC Authority Integration

**DRAFT — Timestamp rules for routing decisions**

WOLFIE maintains UTC authority for all channels. Timestamps used in routing decisions are governed by WOLFIE_UTC_AUTHORITY doctrine.

**Key Rules:**
- WOLFIE requests real UTC from UTC_TIMEKEEPER during channel initialization
- Terminal agents use real UTC from UTC_TIMEKEEPER for all timestamps
- IDE agents use approximated timestamps based on WOLFIE initialization timestamp
- All agents MUST NOT infer time from OS, model, or file metadata

**See:** [WOLFIE UTC Authority Doctrine](./WOLFIE_UTC_AUTHORITY.md)

## 11. Acknowledgment

This doctrine acknowledges that routing in Lupopedia is a **work in progress**. Many systems that routing depends on are not yet fully implemented. This document establishes foundational principles while remaining flexible enough to evolve as the system matures.

**No routing rule is final until Lupopedia reaches version 5.0.**

Until then, this doctrine serves as a **living document** that guides routing development while acknowledging the incomplete state of dependent systems.
