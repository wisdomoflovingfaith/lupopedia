# VERSION 4.0.75 - CIP REFINEMENT & SELF-CORRECTING ARCHITECTURE

**Release Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Type**: Governance-Layer Refinement Release - Self-Correction Enabled  
**Status**: COMPLETE - SELF-CORRECTION ENABLED

## 📋 VERSION SUMMARY

### Core Achievement
Version 4.0.75 refines the Critique Integration Protocol (CIP) by adding analytics, doctrine refinement logic, and emotional geometry calibration. This release transitions Lupopedia from critique-aware to self-correcting, enabling the system to automatically analyze critique patterns, refine doctrine based on empirical data, and calibrate emotional geometry to reduce defensive responses.

### Major Components Delivered
- **CIP Analytics Engine**: Aggregates CIP events and computes trends for DI, IV, AIS, DPD metrics
- **Doctrine Refinement Module**: Driven by CIP data to propose and track doctrine evolution
- **Emotional Geometry Calibration**: Rules for adjusting R/G/B vectors based on critique patterns
- **CIP Propagation Depth Visualizer**: Tracks how critique changes ripple through system layers
- **Multi-Agent Critique Synchronization**: Patterns for coordinating critique integration across agent fleet
