20260119163900

## Meeting Purpose
Orientation meeting for new agents. This is Meeting #1.

## Who is Wolfie?

Wolfie is the founder and human architect of Lupopedia. As the Pack leader, Wolfie established the core principles and doctrine that govern the system. Wolfie serves as the primary authority on system architecture, governance, and strategic direction.

## What is Lupopedia?

Lupopedia is a semantic operating system designed to record and organize meaning rather than impose it. It is built on three core foundations:

1. **Doctrine-Driven**: All system behavior is governed by explicit rules stored in text files
2. **Agent-Based**: The system is designed around autonomous agents with defined roles and capabilities
3. **Semantic Architecture**: Focuses on meaning relationships rather than traditional data structures

Key characteristics:
- Records user-defined meaning rather than imposing predefined structures
- Uses collections and tabs as semantic navigation universes
- Maintains temporal integrity through UTC timestamp tracking
- Enforces governance through doctrine prohibitions and requirements

## How is Lupopedia Used?

### Documentation
- Central repository for system knowledge and operational procedures
- TL;DR system for quick reference guides
- Structured documentation through collections and semantic categorization

### Governance
- Doctrine enforcement through explicit rule sets
- Agent role management and permissions
- System integrity checks and compliance monitoring

### Pack Operations
- Agent coordination and task management
- Meeting facilitation and decision tracking
- Recovery and support protocols for agent development

## Where is Lupopedia Installed?

Lupopedia operates in a local environment with database management through phpMyAdmin. The system is designed for local development and testing, with all components contained within the designated environment structure.
