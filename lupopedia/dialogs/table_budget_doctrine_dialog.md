# Table Budget Doctrine Establishment

## **WOLFIE**: Architectural Boundary Established

The 111 table limit is now formalized as **Truth Layer 1** invariant.

**Core Principle**: Cognitive load boundary for single-schema governance.

**Schema Federation Framework**:
- `lupopedia_core` (≤111 tables)
- `lupopedia_orchestration` (unlimited)
- `lupopedia_ephemeral` (auto-purged)
- `lupopedia_analytics` (read-only)

**Enforcement Protocol**: Pre-commit hooks + monitoring dashboard

**Status**: ARCHITECTURAL INVARIANT ESTABLISHED

## **LILITH**: Critical Governance Tension

**Budget Pressure Detection**: Current audit shows 145 total tables
- 111 core tables (at limit)
- 22 orchestration tables (misplaced)
- 12 ephemeral tables (misplaced)

**Tension Points**:
- Identity core exceeds limit by 2 tables
- Behavioral core exceeds limit by 5 tables
- Orchestration tables polluting core schema

**Resolution Required**: Schema federation implementation

---

## **WOLFITH**: Reality Interrogation

**Assumption Challenge**: Single schema can scale indefinitely
**Reality Check**: Cognitive fragmentation occurs beyond 111 tables
**Question**: What breaks when semantic coherence degrades?

**Interrogation Results**:
- Relationship mapping becomes unreliable
- Agent coordination fails
- Truth layer propagation slows
- Federated identity conflicts increase

**Conclusion**: 111 limit is real constraint, not artificial

## **LUPOPEDIA**: Environmental Architecture

**Current State**: Schema boundary violation detected
**Environmental Impact**:
- Performance degradation from oversized core schema
- Migration complexity from table sprawl
- Governance overhead from unclassified tables

**Environmental Response**: Implement schema federation

**Action Items**:
1. Move orchestration tables to dedicated schema
2. Move ephemeral tables to auto-purged schema
3. Classify and federate excess core tables
4. Implement pre-commit validation hooks

---

## **RESOLUTION PROTOCOL**

**Phase 1**: Schema Federation Setup
- Create separate schemas
- Update connection configurations
- Implement cross-schema relationships

**Phase 2**: Table Migration
- Move 22 orchestration tables
- Move 12 ephemeral tables
- Federate 7 excess core tables

**Phase 3**: Enforcement Implementation
- Pre-commit hooks for 111 table limit
- Monitoring dashboard for compliance
- Automated violation detection

**Timeline**: 4 weeks for complete implementation

---

## **DOCTRINE STATUS**

**Table Budget Doctrine**: ESTABLISHED
**Migration Orchestrator**: DESIGNED
**Schema Federation**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Compliance Monitoring**: PENDING SETUP

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
