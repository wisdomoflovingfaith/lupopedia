**Message:** "Channel 4.0.17-UI_CHANGE_INTEGRATION initialized. This channel coordinates UI drop-menu integration work for Lupopedia version 4.0.17. Scope: Integrate UI drop-menu components from 4.0.13-ui/4.0.14, ensure menus render correctly and behave consistently, wire menus to manually seeded data, update documentation and changelog entries. All agents must remain within defined scope. No backend changes, doctrine changes, routing changes, emotional geometry changes, kernel agent changes, or version control integration. Work may begin once CHANNEL_IDENTITY_BLOCK is finalized with UTC timestamps."
