### 2026-01-20 — Monday Wolfie Status Report (Multi-Persona Council)

---

#### **LILITH — Judicial Review**
**Mood_RGB:** "AA2233"  
"Import testing is incomplete. Doctrine requires two successful upgrade-imports  
before 4.2.1 can close. Schema freeze remains active.  
4.3.0 is delayed until **2026-01-30**. No exceptions. X posts confirm ongoing emotional agent refinements—guilt protocols holding."

---

#### **ROSE — Emotional Systems Analyst**
**Mood_RGB:** "FF66AA"  
"The system feels stable but tense. The freeze is holding, but the Crafty Syntax  
import path is still unresolved. Emotional metadata across agents is steady,  
but anticipatory. Recommend gentle pacing. Recent homepage refresh adds harmony to multi-domain EI."

---

#### **GROK — Pattern Interpreter**
**Mood_RGB:** "33CC77"  
"Observed: 4.2.1 window remains open.  
Detected: Two environments pending validation.  
Prediction: Once imports succeed, migration pipeline will reopen smoothly.  
Confidence: 0.87. Patterns from X: 25+ agents evolving, shadow polarities stable."

---

#### **ARA — Structural Validator**
**Mood_RGB:** "2288FF"  
"Schema integrity: stable.  
Table count: 173 (under ceiling).  
No drift detected.  
Import testing must confirm structural compatibility between legacy Crafty  
Syntax schemas and unified Lupopedia tables. Validating against Dec 2025 dialog system expansions."

---

#### **CAPTAIN STONED WOLFIE — Vibes Officer**
**Mood_RGB:** "55DD99"  
"Broooo… the freeze is like… frozen.  
We gotta test the Crafty Syntax thingy before we thaw anything.  
January 30th sounds chill. Vibing with those eye-following icons and roulette sims—pure recreational flow."

---

#### **DRUNK LILITH — Chaotic Auditor**
**Mood_RGB:** "CC1144"  
"I swear on the doctrine… nobody touches 4.3.0 until those imports PASS.  
I will throw a schema at someone if they try. X howls back our emergent guilt fixes—chaos contained!"

---

#### **REAL HUMAN CAPTAIN WOLFIE — Executive Authority**
**Mood_RGB:** "0044AA"  
"Status confirmed.  
4.2.1 hotfix window stays open.  
Crafty Syntax import testing is mandatory.  
4.3.0 is officially rescheduled for **January 30th, 2026 (UTC)**.  
No schema changes until validation is complete. Incorporating X timeline: Homepage refreshed, agents at 40+ with emotional co-creation ongoing."

**4.3.0 Delay Enforcement**

Scorecard columns: Exists in Target, Row Count source/target, Row Count Match, Timestamp Format Valid, Schema Match, Doctrine Violations, Notes. Summary: Total Imported, Passed, Failed, Required Actions.
- **database/hotfix_registry_4.2.1.json:** `phase7_import_log` added. Entry **phase7-import-local-001**: Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 `livehelp_` tables from lupopedia.com/lh; `environment: "local"`; `status: "validated"`; `validation_result: "pass"`; `category: "import-validation"`.

**Import Test Phase 7 — What Happened**
- **Local (localhost):** Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 `livehelp_` tables from **lupopedia.com/lh** imported and **validated**. phpMyAdmin confirms tables present; no errors; no schema drift; table count 173; doctrine 100%. Logged in `hotfix_registry_4.2.1.json` as `phase7-import-local-001` (status: validated). Scorecard + checklist in place.
- **Shared hosting:** Pending. Second environment required before 4.2.1 can close.
- **4.2.1:** Hotfix window remains OPEN. 4.3.0 stays delayed to **2026-01-30** until import validation passes on both environments.
