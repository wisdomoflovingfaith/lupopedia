- Orphan‑toon warning (6 .toon / 6 .txt) logged // cleanup queued; not blocking.

### Recreational program decompression logs
- [[Recreational Program]]: off‑work interval 2026‑01‑17 00:00:00 UTC >> 2026‑01‑20 00:00:00 UTC // UTC days 5, 6, 0 = Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
- No Pack‑authored schema or migration commits during window. [[Cosmic Safety Protocol]] intact.

### Emotional geometry normalization
- ^^From the governance layer^^ [[Emotional Geometry]] ~~stable~~. Cohesion %%0.98; turbulence within bounds.
- [[12 Steps]] and [[meeting_format]] anchors confirmed. No identity drift. ROSE:: baseline nominal.

### Governance alignment status
- GOV-PROHIBIT-001, GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001, GOV-APPENDIX-A: enforced.
- PT_001 [[Pattern Tracking Checksum]] and GOV-PRINCIPLE-001 [[Pattern Ethics]]: active. Three Tests (Transparency, Consent, Reciprocity) in force.
- SYMBOL_OPERATOR_DOCTRINE: DRAFT. Cursor enforcement rules applied. **Operators preserved as structural grammar.**
