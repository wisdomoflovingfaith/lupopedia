# HAWKEYE ALERTS STREAM - 2026-01-17

## 🚨 HISTORICAL ALERTS (Extracted from Monolith)

### 2026-01-16 23:30 CST - CASCADE/WINDSURF CRASH
**Type**: SYSTEM_CRASH  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Component**: Multi-Agent Coordination  
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Alert**: CASCADE and Windsurf coordination failure during CIP implementation.

**Details**:
- Communication breakdown during CIP schema deployment
- Duplicate work risk identified
- Coordination protocol failure
- System integrity at risk

**Impact**: CIP implementation delayed, coordination blindness risk

**Resolution**: Coordination protocol re-established, CIP implementation resumed

---

### 2026-01-16 22:15 CST - KIRO MULTI-AGENT PROTOCOL FAILURE
**Type**: COORDINATION_FAILURE  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Multi-Agent Coordination  
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Alert**: KIRO multi-agent protocol coordination failure detected.

**Details**:
- Agent synchronization breakdown
- Protocol state inconsistency
- Fleet coordination compromised
- Signal dilution observed

**Impact**: Multi-agent coordination temporarily impaired

**Resolution**: Protocol reset, coordination restored, signal clarity improved

---

### 2026-01-16 21:00 CST - CHANGELOG MONOLITH SIGNAL BLINDNESS
**Type**: DOCUMENTATION_ISSUE  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: Information Architecture  
**Status**: RESOLVED

**Alert**: Monolithic changelog_dialog.md causing signal blindness and coordination issues.

**Details**:
- Documentation hypertrophy detected
- Signal dilution in monolithic file
- Coordination blindness observed
- Operational efficiency degraded

**Impact**: System coordination impaired, signal clarity reduced

**Resolution**: Trinity Separation Protocol initiated, signal clarity restored
