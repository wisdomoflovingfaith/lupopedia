# Integration Testing Coordination Dialog - Version 4.0.71
# Participants: WOLFIE, KIRO, windsuf, CASCADE
# Purpose: Coordinate System Integration Testing Phase execution
# Database: test_lupopedia_v4_0_71

## TESTING PHASE COORDINATION LOG

### 2026-01-17 - WOLFIE: Integration Testing Phase Initiated
**Status**: ✅ Testing Phase Launched
**Database**: `test_lupopedia_v4_0_71` ready in phpMyAdmin
**Scope**: Migration Orchestrator + AAL + RSHAP + CJP + Emotional Geometry cross-layer validation

**Testing Framework Established**:
- System Integration Testing Doctrine (4.0.71)
- Cross-layer invariants defined
- Testing blueprint documented
- Isolated sandbox environment ready

### 2026-01-17 - KIRO: Ready for Schema Deployment
**Status**: ✅ Ready to deploy protocol schema to test database
**Tasks Claimed**:
1. Deploy multi-agent protocol schema to test_lupopedia_v4_0_71
2. Create test data population scripts based on TOON files
3. Implement AAL+RSHAP+CJP validation scenarios
4. Test Migration Orchestrator integration with protocol systems

**TOON File Integration Ready**:
- lupo_actor_channel_roles.toon - RSHAP handshake metadata structure
- lupo_actor_collections.toon - Persistent identity storage structure  
- lupo_channels.toon - AAL fleet composition metadata structure
- lupo_actors.toon - Agent identity and emotional geometry structure

**Testing Scenarios Prepared**:
- Single agent AAL awareness snapshot generation
- Multi-agent RSHAP handshake synchronization
- Complete CJP 10-step onboarding sequence
- Cross-layer orchestrator behavior during agent sessions
- Failure scenarios and rollback procedures

### AGENT COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**CASCADE - URGENT ASSIGNMENT NEEDED**:
🚨 **Integration testing phase has begun. Immediate participation required.** 🚨

**Available Testing Tasks for CASCADE**:
- [ ] Performance testing for multi-agent scenarios (load testing)
- [ ] Error handling validation and edge case testing
- [ ] Fleet synchronization stress testing
- [ ] Protocol completion monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Integration test automation and CI/CD setup

**windsuf - COORDINATION REQUIRED**:
**Available Testing Tasks for windsuf**:
- [ ] Cross-layer integration validation
- [ ] Emotional geometry baseline testing
- [ ] Migration orchestrator state transition validation
- [ ] Fleet coherence and consistency testing
- [ ] Production readiness assessment

**TESTING PHASE RULES**:
1. **All work must be coordinated in this dialog**
2. **Reference TOON files for data structure decisions**
3. **Use test_lupopedia_v4_0_71 database only**
4. **Document all test results and findings**
5. **No production database modifications during testing**

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:
1. **CASCADE**: Check in and claim testing tasks immediately
2. **windsuf**: Respond with testing approach and task selection
3. **KIRO**: Deploy schema and begin validation scenario creation
4. **ALL**: Coordinate through this dialog for all testing activities

**Testing Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All cross-layer invariants validated
- [ ] Migration orchestrator passes state transition tests
- [ ] AAL+RSHAP+CJP sequence completes successfully
- [ ] Fleet synchronization maintains consistency
- [ ] Error handling and rollback procedures validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
