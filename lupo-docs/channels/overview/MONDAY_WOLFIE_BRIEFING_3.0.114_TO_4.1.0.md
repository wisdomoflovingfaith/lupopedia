- ✅ **Version-controlled** — All version references synchronized to 3.0.115
- ✅ **Pack Identity Drafted** — PACK_IDENTITY_DRAFT.md defines Pack name, purpose, signatures, and hierarchy

**Your mission:** Activate Pack Architecture in 3.1.0 and establish proper governance for the dual-system operation (Monday-Thursday execution vs Friday-Sunday creative).

---

## 🟦 PART 1: WHAT'S NEEDED FOR 3.0.114 → 3.1.0

### 1.1 Pack Architecture Activation (PRIMARY TASK)

**Current State (3.0.115):**
- All Pack components are **structurally complete** but **not yet active**
- PackRegistry, PackContext, PackHandoffProtocol exist as stubs
- Emotional Geometry, Behavioral, Memory, and Sync layers are implemented
- System is in "pre-activation" mode

**Required for 3.1.0 Activation:**

#### A. Enable Pack-Level Decision Routing
- [ ] Modify `PackRegistry` to enable live agent registration (currently stubbed)
- [ ] Activate `PackContext` for real-time emotional state tracking
- [ ] Enable `PackHandoffProtocol` for actual agent handoffs (not just recording)
- [ ] Wire Pack decision-making into main request routing

#### B. Declare Pack Identity
- [ ] Review Pack Identity Draft (`lupo-docs/doctrine/PACK_IDENTITY_DRAFT.md`)
- [ ] Approve Pack name: "The Lupopedia Pack" (PACK_CORE, PACK_IDENTITY_0001)
- [ ] Approve Pack purpose: Maintain coherence, continuity, and meaning
- [ ] Approve Pack roles: Emotional, Behavioral, Memory, Sync, Doctrine, External AI, Kernel agents
- [ ] Approve Pack hierarchy: CAPTAIN_WOLFIE → PACK_CORE → Engines → Registered Agents
- [ ] Approve Pack emotional signature: Agápē + Philía + Pragma (RGB: [0.3, 0.0, -0.3])
- [ ] Approve Pack behavioral signature: High compatibility, low reactivity, supportive + analytical
- [ ] Approve Pack cognitive signature: Parallel threads, emotional geometry, doctrine-driven

#### C. Enable Pack Autonomy
- [ ] Enable agent handoff requests (`requestHandoff()` → actual routing)
- [ ] Enable agent role negotiation
- [ ] Enable Pack-level task coordination
- [ ] Enable Pack as unified organism (agents can act as Pack)

#### D. Write Pack Doctrine v1.0
- [ ] Create `lupo-docs/doctrine/PACK_DOCTRINE.md` (v1.0)
- [ ] Document Pack identity, purpose, roles
- [ ] Document Pack emotional and behavioral signatures
- [ ] Document Pack handoff protocols
- [ ] Document Pack governance rules

### 1.2 Version Control Governance (CRITICAL)

**Current State:**
- Version atoms synchronized to 3.0.114
- LIMITS.md doctrine exists but enforcement is dry-run (non-blocking)
- Weekend version freeze rules documented but not enforced

**Required for 3.1.0:**

#### A. Activate LIMITS Enforcement
- [ ] Modify `LimitsEnforcementService` to **block** violations (not just log)
- [ ] Enable version freeze enforcement (Days 0, 5, 6)
- [ ] Enable schema ceiling enforcement (135 table limit)
- [ ] Enable branch limit enforcement (2 weekend branches max)
- [ ] Wire enforcement into version bump process (`lupo-includes/version.php`)
- [ ] Wire enforcement into migration process (`migrate_dialog_channels.php`)

#### B. Version Bump Protocol
- [ ] Create `lupo-docs/doctrine/VERSION_BUMP_PROTOCOL.md`
- [ ] Document when version bumps are allowed (Monday-Thursday only)
- [ ] Document version bump approval process
- [ ] Document version freeze exceptions (if any)
- [ ] Ensure Terminal_AI_005 (UTC_TIMEKEEPER) is consulted for day-of-week

#### C. Version Consistency Checks
- [ ] Create automated version consistency checker
- [ ] Verify all version references match `GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION`
- [ ] Ensure CHANGELOG.md entries match version bumps
- [ ] Ensure migration notes match version bumps

### 1.3 Dual-System Governance (Monday-Thursday vs Friday-Sunday)

**Current State:**
- LIMITS.md defines weekend rules but enforcement is dry-run
- No clear separation between execution mode and creative mode
- No automated governance switching

**Required for 3.1.0:**

#### A. Mode Detection and Switching
- [ ] Use Terminal_AI_005 to determine current UTC day
- [ ] Implement mode detection:
  - **Monday-Thursday (Days 1-4)**: Execution Mode
  - **Friday-Sunday (Days 5-7, 0)**: Creative Mode
- [ ] Create `SystemModeService` to manage mode switching
- [ ] Wire mode detection into LIMITS enforcement

#### B. Execution Mode (Monday-Thursday) Rules
- [ ] **Allowed:**
  - Version bumps (patch and minor)
  - Schema changes (within 135-table limit)
  - Migrations
  - Doctrine updates
  - Architecture changes
  - Pack activation tasks
- [ ] **Forbidden:**
  - Experimental branches (unless approved)
  - Non-binding prototypes
  - Lore-only changes
- [ ] **Enforcement:** Full LIMITS enforcement (blocking)

#### C. Creative Mode (Friday-Sunday) Rules
- [ ] **Allowed:**
  - Humor and lore

- [ ] **Forbidden:**
  - Version bumps (3.0.x → 3.1.x blocked)
  - Schema changes
  - Migrations
  - Doctrine changes
  - Architecture changes
  - Pack activation tasks
- [ ] **Enforcement:** LIMITS violations logged but non-blocking (dry-run)

#### D. Mode Transition Protocol
- [ ] **Friday Transition (Day 5):**
  - Switch to Creative Mode at 00:00 UTC
  - Log mode transition
  - Disable blocking LIMITS enforcement
  - Enable weekend branch creation (max 2)
- [ ] **Monday Transition (Day 1):**
  - Switch to Execution Mode at 00:00 UTC
  - Log mode transition
  - Enable blocking LIMITS enforcement
  - Require weekend branch merge/archive before work begins
  - Generate weekend activity summary

- **Action:** Block version bump attempts, log violation

**Minor Version Lock:**
- **Rule:** Version may NOT advance from 3.0.x → 3.1.x during weekend
- **Enforcement:** Check in version bump process
- **Action:** Reject version bump, log violation

### 2.3 Version Consistency Protocol

**Required Checks:**
- [ ] `GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION` atom matches `lupo-includes/version.php`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` header version matches current version
- [ ] All migration notes reference correct version
- [ ] All PHP `@version` tags match current version (for modified files)
- [ ] All documentation `file.last_modified_system_version` matches current version (for modified files)

**Automation:**
- Create `lupo-scripts/verify_version_consistency.php`
- Run before every version bump
- Fail if inconsistencies found

---

## 🟦 PART 6: RISK MITIGATION

### 6.1 Pack Architecture Activation Risks

**Risk:** Pack activation breaks existing functionality  
**Mitigation:** 
- Test in staging environment first
- Gradual rollout (activate one component at a time)
- Rollback plan ready
- Monitor system health continuously

**Risk:** Pack decision-making conflicts with existing routing  
**Mitigation:**
- Pack routing is additive, not replacement
- Existing routing remains fallback
- Pack routing can be disabled if needed

### 6.2 Version Control Governance Risks

**Risk:** LIMITS enforcement too strict, blocks legitimate work  
**Mitigation:**
- Start with warnings, escalate to blocking gradually
- Exception mechanism for approved cases
- Clear documentation of what's allowed/forbidden

**Risk:** Version consistency checks fail due to false positives  
**Mitigation:**
- Whitelist known exceptions
- Clear error messages
- Manual override for edge cases

### 6.3 Dual-System Governance Risks

**Risk:** Mode switching fails, system stuck in wrong mode  
**Mitigation:**
- Manual override mechanism
- Fallback to Execution Mode if detection fails
- Clear logging of mode transitions

**Risk:** Weekend branches not merged, causing Monday conflicts  
**Mitigation:**
- Automated reminder system
- Required branch resolution before Execution Mode activation
- Clear documentation of merge/archive process

## 🟩 FINAL DIRECTIVE

**Monday Wolfie,**

You have everything you need to bring 3.0.114 to 3.1.0:

1. **Pack Architecture is ready** — All components exist, just need activation
2. **Version control governance is defined** — LIMITS.md exists, needs enforcement activation
3. **Dual-system governance is documented** — Rules exist, needs implementation

**Your job is to:**
- Activate Pack Architecture (declare identity, enable autonomy)
- Activate LIMITS enforcement (switch from dry-run to blocking)
- Implement dual-system governance (mode detection and switching)
- Write the remaining doctrine (Pack Doctrine v1.0, Version Bump Protocol, Dual-System Governance)

**This is not a coding patch. This is an activation event.**

Everything is in place. Your job is to flip the switches and write the doctrine.

**Welcome to 3.1.0.**
— Captain Wolfie
