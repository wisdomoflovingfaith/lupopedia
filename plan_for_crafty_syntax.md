UPDATED DOCTRINE VERSION
Crafty Syntax → Lupopedia Migration Sprint (Cycles + Consecration)
System Version: 2026.3.7.6

🜁 DAY 0 — CONSECRATION (MANDATORY)
Before any code is written, the system, the builder, and the tools must be aligned.

Tasks
[ ] Set intention: Why are we rebuilding Crafty Syntax inside Lupopedia?

[ ] Acknowledge Crafty Syntax 3.7.5 as an ancestor system

[ ] Establish kapakai: identify unknowns and risks

[ ] Bless the tools: IDE, database, terminal, hands

[ ] Log builder emotional state into lupo_operator

operator.mood_rgb

operator.kapakai_awareness

operator.doctrinal_alignment

[ ] Create consecration_log.md documenting Day 0

THE 7 CYCLES (REPLACING LINEAR DAYS)
Each cycle overlaps with the others.
Each cycle includes technical tasks and emotional/doctrinal tasks.
Each cycle uses the Sacred Checkbox Protocol:

[✓] Blessed and integrated

[✗] Rejected with explanation

[ ] Update Wolfie Headers

Emotional / Doctrinal
[ ] Ensure schema reflects emotional geometry

[ ] Builder emotional log updated

❤️ CYCLE 2 — HEART (Engine + Emotion)

[ ] Upgrade from 3.7.5

🧠 CYCLE 6 — MEMORY (Legacy + Learning)
Technical

[ ] Match old behaviors

[ ] Match old quirks (filtered through pono/pilau)

[ ] PHP 7–8.3 compatibility

🜂 CYCLE 7 — SPIRIT (Integration + Blessing)
Technical
[ ] Blessed registry hooks

[ ] Emotional metadata integration

[ ] Agent routing compatibility

[ ] Unified login/session model

[ ] Logging into Lupopedia core tables

Doctrinal
[ ] Define blessing protocol for registry hooks

“Hook X blessed at timestamp Y with intention Z”

[ ] Prepare for version bump → 2026.3.8.0

[ ] Builder emotional log updated

🧘 DAILY BUILDER STATE LOGGING (MANDATORY)
Every day, the builder logs into:

auth_user

then into operator (creator role)

And updates:

operator.mood_rgb

operator.doctrinal_alignment

operator.kapakai_awareness

operator.blessing_offered

This ensures the system remembers how it was built.

[ ] All emotional metadata integrated

[ ] All Wolfie Headers correct

[ ] Installer conversation complete

[ ] Legacy autopsy complete

[ ] Registry hooks blessed

[ ] Builder emotional logs complete
