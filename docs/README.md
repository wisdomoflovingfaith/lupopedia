# Documentation Index

This directory hosts doctrine files, architecture notes, emotional-metadata specifications, and multi-agent rules. It keeps core philosophy and technical references organized outside the repository root.

If you add a new doctrine or architectural note, place it here (or in the appropriate subfolder) and link it from `README.md`.

## Core Architecture

- **[Channel System Doctrine (5100-5130)](../channels/5100/identity-layer-architecture.md)** - Lupopedia Channel Architecture: Complete documentation of the Semantic OS identity layer covering channels, actors, and memberships.

### Channel Numbering Clarifications

Lupopedia currently contains ~222 channels.

Channel numbers are not sequential and do not represent a fixed range.

High values (e.g., 5100-series) are intentional and correspond to subsystem groupings.

channel_number is a semantic identifier, not an index or capacity limit.

The total count of channels is meaningful; the numeric gaps between them are not.

This ensures contributors understand that channel numbering is non-linear by design and should not be interpreted as a contiguous namespace.
