# Documentation Index

This directory hosts doctrine files, architecture notes, emotional-metadata specifications, and multi-agent rules. It keeps core philosophy and technical references organized outside the repository root.

If you add a new doctrine or architectural note, place it here (or in the appropriate subfolder) and link it from `README.md`.
