## 12. Mandated Header Comments (v4.0.48+)

Starting with version 4.0.48, every FLARE header MUST begin with a specific comment line linking to the authoritative web resolution. This enables human and machine consumers to quickly access the interactive documentation and Q&A for the protocol.

**Format:**
```yaml
# FLARE Header (aliases: Wolfie, FLIP, FLP, FLPH, CROP) see http://www.lupopedia.com/lupopedia/content/FLARE and see http://www.lupopedia.com/lupopedia/qa/FLARE
flare.headers:
  ...
```

**Reasoning:**
- **Accessibility**: Direct links for external agents and researchers.
- **Authority**: Verifies that the file follows the canonical Lupopedia protocol.
- **Portability**: Ensures the protocol remains self-documenting even outside the repository environment.
