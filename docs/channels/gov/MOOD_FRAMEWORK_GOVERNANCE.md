# Mood Framework Governance

## Purpose

Governance rules for mood frameworks and RGB standards.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Mood RGB outputs must follow the Mood RGB doctrine.
- Mood framework changes require versioned updates and documentation.
- Thread-level mood data is owned by threads, not channels.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
