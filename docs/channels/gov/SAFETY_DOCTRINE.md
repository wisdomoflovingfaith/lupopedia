# Safety Doctrine

## Purpose

System-wide safety constraints that override convenience or optimization.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Safety overrides performance, novelty, or speed when in conflict.
- All agents comply with safety doctrine before executing actions.
- Safety checks must be documented in dialog or audit logs.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
