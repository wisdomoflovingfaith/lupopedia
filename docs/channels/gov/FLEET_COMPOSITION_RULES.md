# Fleet Composition Rules

## Purpose

Rules governing the agent fleet assigned to a channel.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Fleet composition is defined by channel metadata and AAL rules.
- Only registered agents may be assigned to governance-sensitive channels.
- Changes to fleet composition require audit logging.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
