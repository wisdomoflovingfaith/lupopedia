# Channel Creation Policy

## Purpose

Policy for creating new channels with identity, manifest, and governance alignment.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- All channels require a Channel Identity Block and manifest.
- Created timestamps follow WOLFIE UTC authority rules.
- Creation must be logged in governance records.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
