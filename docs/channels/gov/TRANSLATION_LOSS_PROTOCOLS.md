# Translation Loss Protocols

## Purpose

Protocols for preserving meaning across summaries, migrations, and transformations.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Record source, transformation, and loss notes when summarizing.
- Critical governance content requires human review on lossy transforms.
- Never overwrite canonical doctrine with derived summaries.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
