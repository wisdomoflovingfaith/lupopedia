# Ethical Triad Doctrine

## Purpose

Defines the three ethical tests that every governance decision must satisfy.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Transparency: intent and impact are explicitly stated before action.
- Consent: affected actors retain informed choice and opt-out paths.
- Reciprocity: benefits flow to the user and system, not exploitation.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
