# Meta Doctrine

## Purpose

Rules for doctrine hierarchy, conflicts, and precedence.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- When doctrine conflicts arise, follow the documented precedence chain.
- Meta rules define how doctrines are versioned and reconciled.
- Changes to doctrine must be documented and traceable.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
