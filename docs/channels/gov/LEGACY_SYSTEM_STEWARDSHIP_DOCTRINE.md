# Legacy System Stewardship Doctrine

## Purpose

Rules for stewarding legacy systems and migrations.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Preserve legacy behavior unless doctrine requires change.
- Document all legacy mapping and refactor decisions.
- Legacy data must remain auditable and reversible.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
