# Restorative Governance Doctrine

## Purpose

Governance response and remediation when rules are violated.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Document incidents, root cause, and corrective action in changelog.
- Prefer reversibility, rollback, and reconciliation over deletion.
- Publish a clear remediation plan with validation steps.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
