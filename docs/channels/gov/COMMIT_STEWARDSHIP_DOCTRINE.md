# Commit Stewardship Doctrine

## Purpose

Rules for responsible commits and change stewardship.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Commits must be atomic, documented, and aligned with doctrine.
- No destructive operations without explicit approval.
- Commit messages must reflect governance intent.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
