# Heritage Safe Migration Rules

## Purpose

Safety rules for migrations that touch legacy or historical data.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Legacy migrations must be reversible and documented.
- Preserve data lineage and mapping records.
- Validate against doctrine before execution.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
