# Pluralistic Emotion Model Governance

## Purpose

Rules for maintaining multiple emotional models without conflict.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Multiple models may coexist when clearly scoped and documented.
- Model conflicts require governance review and resolution.
- Cross-model translation must preserve semantic intent.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
