# Schema Evolution Protocol

## Purpose

Protocol for schema changes and long-term evolution.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Schema changes must respect no-FK, no-trigger, no-procedure rules.
- TOON files must reflect schema updates.
- Schema evolution requires migration approval and logging.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
