# Kernel Governance Rules

## Purpose

Rules for changes affecting kernel channels and boot sequence.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Kernel channels are reserved and require WOLFIE authority.
- Boot sequence order must remain deterministic and documented.
- Kernel changes require explicit audit trails.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
