# Kapu Rules Doctrine

## Purpose

Immutable prohibitions enforced by governance and kernel authority.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- No foreign keys, triggers, or stored procedures in the database.
- Table count limits and schema constraints are non-negotiable.
- Prohibitions are enforced before any migration or deployment.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
