# Channel Registry Governance

## Purpose

Rules for maintaining the canonical channel registry.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Registry is derived from lupo_channels and must be regenerated, not hand edited.
- Channel keys must be unique and follow naming rules.
- Registry changes require changelog entries.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
