# Identity and Channel Provenance Rules

## Purpose

Rules for preserving channel identity and provenance over time.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Channel identity is defined by the Channel Identity Block.
- Manifests and timestamps must remain traceable and consistent.
- Provenance changes require explicit governance record.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
