# Emotional Geometry Governance

## Purpose

Governance rules for emotional geometry models and calibration.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Emotional geometry models must be documented and versioned.
- Calibration changes require governance review.
- Do not override emotional state rules outside the doctrine.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
