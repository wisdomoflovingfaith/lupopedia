# Versioning Governance

## Purpose

Governance rules for version increments, freezes, and releases.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Version increments follow the official versioning doctrine.
- Breaking changes require migration notes and explicit approval.
- Freeze protocols supersede convenience or speed.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
