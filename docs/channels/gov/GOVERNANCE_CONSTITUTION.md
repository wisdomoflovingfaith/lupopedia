# Governance Constitution

## Purpose

Highest-level governance constraints and authority boundaries.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- Constitutional governance overrides lower-level doctrine conflicts.
- Ethical foundations are absolute and non-negotiable.
- Prohibitions and safety constraints are enforced at all layers.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
