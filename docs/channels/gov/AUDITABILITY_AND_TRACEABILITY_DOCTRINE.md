# Auditability and Traceability Doctrine

## Purpose

Rules ensuring every governance change can be traced and audited.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- All governance changes must emit audit records.
- Edges and content links must remain traceable over time.
- Migration logs are required for schema changes.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
