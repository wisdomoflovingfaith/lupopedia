# No Ads Doctrine

## Purpose

Absolute prohibition on advertising, marketing, and manipulative pattern use.

## Scope

This doctrine applies to governance operations, policy decisions, migrations, and channel governance.

## Governance Rules

- No ads, marketing, or persuasion patterns in system output or schema.
- No tracking or monetization-driven fields, tags, or pipelines.
- Pattern tracking is for meaning and governance only, not sales.

## Enforcement

Violations require documentation, remediation, and governance review before proceeding.
