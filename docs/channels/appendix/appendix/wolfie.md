# Who is Wolfie

"Wolfie" is the mythic and working name of Eric Robin Gerdes, the original creator and ongoing steward of Lupopedia.

## Lived context

Wolfie did not design Lupopedia from an ivory tower. The system comes out of:

- the death of his wife
- years of addiction, bad habits, and destructive choices
- 17 months in jail
- 10 months in rehab
- another marriage lost through his own actions
- deep exposure to "how not to live"

After getting sober, he spent years studying patterns in human belief and narrative, including 22+ different religions and myth systems. The goal was not to become a preacher, but to understand:

- how humans construct "truth"
- how errors, distortions, and comforting stories accumulate
- how resilience, optimism, and integrity are actually built

## Role in Lupopedia

Wolfie is:

- the **digital archaeologist** of the old Crafty Syntax system
- the **architect** of the new semantic OS
- the **mythic persona** guiding agents like Thoth and Lilith
- the one insisting on strong doctrine, clear boundaries, and explicit documentation

Lupopedia is not a religious project. It is the system Wolfie wishes he had when everything fell apart: something that can hold conflicting claims, evidence, and context without collapsing into dogma or nihilism.

That is why the schema is strict, the table count is disciplined, and the agents are named with symbolic weight. This isn't just software; it's a way of refusing to lie to ourselves about how knowledge and experience actually work.
