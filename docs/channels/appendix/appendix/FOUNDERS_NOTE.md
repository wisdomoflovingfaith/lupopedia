# Founder's Note

**Crafty Syntax â†’ Sales Syntax â†’ Silence â†’ Faith â†’ Lupopedia**

My name is Eric "Wolfie" Gerdes, and Lupopedia wasn't born from ambition. It was born from survival.

## The Beginning: Crafty Syntax (2002)

Back in 2002, I built Crafty Syntax â€” a live help system that somehow ended up everywhere: shared hosting, autoâ€‘installers, cPanel, Fantastico, Softaculous. It wasn't fancy, but it was resilient. It survived every era of PHP and kept running long after I stopped thinking about it.

## The Break: 2014

Then in 2014, my wife died from an overdose after a car accident and a painkiller spiral neither of us saw coming. Overnight, I was a single father raising two kids, and I broke in ways I didn't understand at the time. I didn't "take a break" from programming â€” I threw the computer out the window and disappeared for eleven years.

## The Survival Mechanism: Sales Syntax

During that time, Crafty Syntax mutated into Sales Syntax, but not for the reasons people assume. It wasn't built to automate sales. It was built to automate me. I engineered it so the system could run without me while I fell apart.

Sales Syntax handled everything:

- serverâ€‘side Perl scripts reading raw mail files from /etc/mail
- parsing client data
- crafting emails
- managing inboxes
- timed templates
- followâ€‘ups
- even a strange "unbranding" system I barely remember writing

It was like cloning myself so the program could keep going while I couldn't.

## The Wilderness: 2014-2023

From 2014 to 2023, I lived in a fog of addiction, grief, and survival. It took rehab and my second wife leaving to finally shatter that fog. On October 1, 2023, I got sober â€” and I've stayed that way.

Those years taught me something I never understood before:

**Addicts aren't "bad people."** They're people in pain, making desperate choices. I used to judge them. Then I became one. And in that fall, I learned compassion the hard way.

We're all fed the "bread of adversity and water of affliction," but it's in those trials that we learn. A higher power â€” whatever name you give it â€” uses those moments to build us up if we let it. Through love, forbearance, mercy, passion, and purpose, we forge resilience. And that experience gives us the authority to help others out of their own darkness.

I became the "scum" I once judged.  
And in that, I learned to see hidden pain instead of malice.

## The Learning: Religion and Meaning

After losing one wife to death and another to addictionâ€‘fueled choices, I finally understood the "why" behind suffering. I studied religion deeply â€” twentyâ€‘two traditions, mythic systems, symbolic lineages from Egypt to Christianity. I learned how humans organize meaning, how stories shape identity, and how structure gives life purpose.

## The Return: August 2025

In August 2025, after eleven years without a computer, I thought:

*"Maybe I'll make a small religious website."*

That simple idea became something else entirely.

## The Rebirth: Lupopedia

Crafty Syntax was the ancestor.  
Sales Syntax was the survival mechanism.  
My years in the wilderness were the crucible.  
And Lupopedia became the rebirth.

Lupopedia isn't a CMS.  
It's a semantic operating system â€” a way to organize meaning the same way religions organize wisdom, the same way humans naturally categorize their world.

It runs inside Crafty Syntax installations across thousands of servers.  
It ingests content, organizes it into Collections, learns from navigation, and builds a federated graph of meaning â€” not by crawling the web, but by listening to how people already structure their own information.

It's the most unexpected thing I've ever built.  
And maybe the most necessary.
