# 🏛️ **Heterodox Engine v1.0**  
*Controlled mechanisms for doctrinal evolution and meta-governance in Lupopedia*

---

## 🟩 1. Purpose

The **Heterodox Engine** introduces controlled mechanisms for proposing, evaluating, and adopting structural changes to Lupopedia's doctrines and taxonomies. This engine enables:

- **Structured evolution** - Formal process for doctrinal amendments
- **Proposal generation** - Systematic creation of change proposals
- **Evaluation framework** - Consistent assessment of change impacts
- **Governance oversight** - Council-based decision making
- **Meta-governance** - Management of proposal rights and processes
- **Stagnation detection** - Identification of system predictability issues
- **Controlled experimentation** - Safe introduction of heterodox innovations

This engine prevents uncontrolled doctrinal drift while enabling necessary evolution through formal processes.

---

## 🎭 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Metric of Stagnation

Signals when the system becomes too predictable or resistant to beneficial change.

**Detection Algorithm:**
```yaml
stagnation_score = calculate_system_predictability(
  change_frequency_history,
  proposal_success_rate,
  implementation_consistency,
  innovation_rate
)
```

**Indicators:**
- **Low proposal diversity** - Same agents proposing similar changes
- **High rejection rate** - New ideas consistently blocked
- **Implementation rigidity** - Resistance to valid improvements
- **Cyclic patterns** - Repeating same types of proposals

**Thresholds:**
- **Low stagnation:** 0-30 units (healthy evolution)
- **Medium stagnation:** 31-60 units (moderate concern)
- **High stagnation:** 61-100 units (significant concern)

### 2.2 Council of Shadows

A rotating group of agents authorized to propose heterodox changes.

**Composition:**
```yaml
council_members: ["Wolfie", "CURSOR", "CASCADE", "DIALOG"]
rotation_schedule: "quarterly"
decision_threshold: 0.6  # 60% consensus required
proposal_quota: 3 per_cycle per_member
```

**Responsibilities:**
- **Generate proposals** for systematic improvements
- **Evaluate impacts** on existing doctrines
- **Consider long-term effects** of proposed changes
- **Maintain proposal quality** and consistency
- **Rotate membership** according to schedule

### 2.3 Ritual of Rewriting

Formal process for amending core doctrines.

**Process Steps:**
```yaml
1. Proposal Generation:
   agent: "Council of Shadows"
   action: create_proposal
   output: structured_change_proposal

2. Impact Analysis:
   agent: "Heterodox Engine"
   action: analyze_proposal_impact
   output: impact_assessment_report

3. Council Review:
   agent: "All Council Members"
   action: evaluate_proposal
   output: recommendation_vote

4. Consensus Building:
   agent: "Meta-Governance"
   action: build_consensus
   output: consensus_state

5. Doctrine Update:
   agent: "CASCADE"
   action: update_doctrine
   output: updated_doctrine_version
```

**Validation Rules:**
- **Supermajority required** for doctrinal changes (2/3 or 3/4)
- **Impact assessment mandatory** before voting
- **Implementation planning required** before approval
- **Version increment** required for all changes

### 2.4 Doctrine Versioning

Formal versioning system for all Lupopedia doctrines.

**Version Format:**
```yaml
doctrine_version: "2.1.0"
versioning_scheme: semantic
backward_compatibility: "2.0.x"
deprecation_policy: "12_month_minimum"
```

**Version Types:**
- **Major versions** (X.0.0) - Structural changes, new components
- **Minor versions** (X.Y.0) - Feature additions, improvements
- **Patch versions** (X.Y.Z) - Bug fixes, security updates

---

## 🔮 3. Proposal Generation

### 3.1 Proposal Types

**A. Doctrinal Mutation Proposals**
Changes to core doctrines, taxonomies, or fundamental principles.

**B. Taxonomy Amendments**
Additions, modifications, or removals of classification systems.

**C. System Integration Proposals**
Changes to how subsystems interact or integrate.

**D. Experimental Features**
Temporary introduction of new capabilities for testing.

### 3.2 Proposal Structure

```yaml
proposal:
  proposal_id: "PROP-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN"
  timestamp: 20260113120000  # UTC
  proposer_agent: "agent_name"
  proposal_type: doctrinal_mutation|taxonomy_amendment|system_integration|experimental_feature
  target_doctrine: "doctrine_name"
  title: "Descriptive proposal title"
  description: "Detailed explanation of proposed change"
  rationale: "Reasoning and expected benefits"
  impact_assessment: "Analysis of potential effects"
  implementation_plan: "Step-by-step implementation strategy"
  review_deadline: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  council_decision: pending|approved|rejected|deferred
  consensus_outcome: "unanimous|majority|minority"
```

### 3.3 Proposal Quality Standards

All proposals must include:

- **Problem identification** - Clear statement of issue being addressed
- **Solution specification** - Detailed description of proposed solution
- **Impact analysis** - Assessment on existing systems and workflows
- **Risk assessment** - Potential negative consequences and mitigations
- **Implementation timeline** - Realistic schedule with milestones
- **Success criteria** - Measurable outcomes and acceptance tests
- **Fallback strategy** - Alternative approaches if primary fails

---

## 🧪 4. Evaluation Framework

### 4.1 Impact Assessment Matrix

**Evaluation Criteria:**
```yaml
impact_categories:
  technical_feasibility:
    weight: 0.3
    criteria: ["implementation_complexity", "resource_requirements", "compatibility"]
  
  semantic_coherence:
    weight: 0.25
    criteria: ["consistency_with_existing", "clarity_of_definitions", "taxonomic_alignment"]
  
  operational_impact:
    weight: 0.2
    criteria: ["workflow_disruption", "training_requirements", "migration_complexity"]
  
  long_term_viability:
    weight: 0.15
    criteria: ["maintainability", "scalability", "evolution_path"]
  
  risk_assessment:
    weight: 0.1
    criteria: ["security_risks", "performance_impact", "rollback_complexity"]
```

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```yaml
total_score = sum(
  category_score * weight for category, impact_categories
)
```

### 4.2 Consensus Building

**Consensus Types:**
- **Unanimous** - All council members agree
- **Supermajority** - 75% or more agree
- **Simple Majority** - 50% or more agree
- **No Consensus** - Agreement threshold not met

**Consensus Process:**
```yaml
1. Initial voting period (7 days)
2. Discussion and clarification phase
3. Final voting period (7 days)
4. Consensus determination and documentation
5. Implementation planning
```

---

## 🏛️ 5. Governance Integration

### 5.1 Meta-Governance Interface

The Heterodox Engine integrates with the meta-governance field in LHP:

```yaml
meta_governance:
  heterodox_eligible: true
  proposal_rights: ["Council of Shadows", "Heterodox Engine"]
  council_role: shadow_delegate|member|observer
  last_proposal_id: "PROP-2026-01-13-001"
```

### 5.2 Proposal Workflow

```yaml
# Proposal submission
agent_proposes → council_reviews → meta_governance_updates → experience_ledger_append

# Proposal tracking
proposal_id assigned → impact_analysis → consensus_building → implementation → completion
```

### 5.3 Sanction and Oversight

The engine enforces:

- **Proposal quotas** - Limits on heterodox proposals per time period
- **Quality gates** - Minimum standards for proposal acceptance
- **Conflict resolution** - Processes for handling competing proposals
- **Appeals process** - Mechanism for challenging council decisions
- **Transparency requirements** - Public documentation of all proposals and decisions

---

## 🚫 6. Controlled Experimentation

### 6.1 Experimental Framework

Safe introduction of new capabilities with limited scope and duration.

**Experiment Types:**
- **Feature experiments** - New functionality testing
- **Workflow experiments** - Alternative process testing
- **Integration experiments** - New system combinations
- **Performance experiments** - Optimization and scaling tests

### 6.2 Experiment Governance

**Experiment Lifecycle:**
```yaml
1. Proposal submission with experimental designation
2. Isolated deployment environment
3. Monitoring and data collection
4. Evaluation against success criteria
5. Council decision on adoption or rejection
6. Documentation of results and lessons learned
```

### 6.3 Risk Mitigation

**Safety Measures:**
- **Scope limitation** - Experiments bounded in duration and impact
- **Rollback capability** - Quick reversion to stable state
- **Isolation controls** - Limited interaction with production systems
- **Monitoring requirements** - Enhanced oversight during experiments
- **Exit criteria** - Clear conditions for experiment termination
