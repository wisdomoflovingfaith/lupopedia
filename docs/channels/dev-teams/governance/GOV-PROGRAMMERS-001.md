# GOV‑PROGRAMMERS‑001
# Programmer Competency Doctrine for Lupopedia
Channel 3 — PROGRAMMERS OF LUPOPEDIA
Version 2026.1.0.3

## Purpose
This doctrine defines the minimum required knowledge, skill, and engineering discipline for any human contributor working on Lupopedia. The system is a semantic OS, not a framework‑driven application, and therefore requires contributors who understand foundational computer science.

## Baseline Competency Requirement
All programmers contributing to Lupopedia must possess the equivalent of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the 2000–2010 era.

This requirement is non‑negotiable.

## Required Knowledge Areas

### 1. Data Structures
Contributors must understand and be able to implement:

- arrays
- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- trees
- graphs
- heaps
- tries

Not from a library — from first principles.

### 2. Algorithms
Contributors must understand:

- sorting algorithms
- searching algorithms
- recursion
- dynamic programming
- graph traversal
- algorithmic complexity (Big‑O)

They must be able to reason about performance without relying on frameworks.

### 3. Memory & Low‑Level Concepts
Contributors must understand:

- stack vs heap
- pointers and references
- memory allocation
- garbage collection
- cache locality
- CPU behavior
- call stacks
- recursion depth

Lupopedia requires engineers who understand the machine, not abstractions.

### 4. Operating Systems Fundamentals
Contributors must understand:

- processes
- threads
- scheduling
- file systems
- I/O
- concurrency
- synchronization primitives

This is essential for multi‑agent orchestration.

### 5. Networking Basics
Contributors must understand:

- TCP vs UDP
- sockets
- HTTP
- DNS
- latency
- packet flow

Lupopedia interacts with distributed systems and requires engineers who understand the network.

### 6. Database Fundamentals
Contributors must understand:

- relational schema
- normalization
- indexing
- transactions
- ACID
- query planning

Lupopedia is schema‑first and TOON‑driven.

## Programming Ability
Contributors must be able to:

- write code without frameworks
- debug without AI
- reason about architecture
- understand schema
- follow doctrine
- avoid shortcuts
- think in systems

Framework‑only developers are not qualified.

## Testing Requirement
All contributors will be tested in person by the system architect (Eric Robin Gerdes).
This test evaluates:

- actual programming ability
- reasoning
- fundamentals
- architectual thinking

Passing the test is required before contributing to Lupopedia.

## Why This Doctrine Exists
Lupopedia is a semantic operating system with:

- deterministic behavior
- doctrine‑driven architecture
- multi‑agent orchestration
- emotional geometry
- schema‑first design
- TOON‑based metadata
- version governance
- channel‑based context

This system cannot be safely maintained by developers who rely solely on frameworks, abstractions, or AI.

Only engineers with real foundational knowledge can contribute without causing drift or corruption.

## Status
ACTIVE — NON‑NEGOTIABLE  
Applies to all human contributors.
