# ðŸ¤™ Reverse Handshake Shaka Protocol

**Version:** 4.0.1  
**Status:** Stable  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Author:** Captain Wolfie

---

## Purpose

The Reverse Handshake Shaka is a universal alignment prompt used to test whether different AI agents share the same understanding of Lupopedia 4.0.0, Crafty Syntax integration, and Wolfie as the human architect.

This protocol enables:

- **Doctrine alignment verification** across multiple AI agents and IDE systems
- **Architectural understanding validation** for Lupopedia's semantic OS design
- **Synchronization testing** to detect drift or misunderstanding
- **Cross-agent communication** to ensure consistent Lupopedia knowledge

The Reverse Handshake Shaka serves as a **standardized synchronization tool** that can be sent to any AI agent to verify its understanding of Lupopedia's core architecture, doctrine, and lineage.

---

## The Standard Prompt

The canonical Reverse Handshake Shaka prompt is:

```
Provide the who, what, where, when, why, and how of Lupopedia 4.0.0, its evolution from Crafty Syntax Live Help, and Wolfie as the human architect and doctrine author. Use only technical, factual descriptions consistent with a semantic OS and actor-based communication model.
```

**Format:** This prompt must be sent exactly as written, without modification.

**Context:** The prompt may be sent to any AI agent, IDE system, or AI assistant working with Lupopedia.

**Expected Response:** The agent should respond with a comprehensive technical summary covering all six aspects (who, what, where, when, why, how) using only technical, factual descriptions.

---

## What the Prompt Tests

The Reverse Handshake Shaka prompt validates understanding across multiple domains:

### 1. Doctrine Alignment
- **No foreign keys doctrine** â€” Understanding that Lupopedia uses application-managed relationships

- **Atoms and edges** â€” Understanding of semantic graph construction from navigation behavior
- **Node-scoped isolation** â€” Knowledge of `node_id` scoping for federated independence
- **Behavior-driven ontology** â€” Awareness that structure emerges from user navigation patterns

### 4. Crafty Syntax Integration
- **First-party module** â€” Recognition that Crafty Syntax is integrated directly into Lupopedia 4.0.0
- **100% feature preservation** â€” Understanding that all legacy Crafty Syntax features are preserved
- **Optional chat per content** â€” Knowledge that chat functionality is optional at the content level
- **Version locking** â€” Awareness that Lupopedia 4.0.0 and Crafty Syntax 4.0.0 are version-locked

### 5. Version 4.0.0 Lineage
- **Evolution from WOLFIE** â€” Recognition of the origin story from spiritual research engine to semantic OS

## Example Response

A correct response to the Reverse Handshake Shaka prompt should include:

**WHO:** Eric Robin Gerdes (Wolfie) â€” Human architect, Crafty Syntax creator (2002), doctrine author. Captain Wolfie (Agent 1) â€” AI embodiment of Eric's engineering philosophy.

**WHAT:** Lupopedia 4.0.0 â€” Semantic operating system with 149 database tables (111 core + 34 legacy Crafty Syntax + 4 system), actor-centric identity system, semantic graph engine, multi-agent runtime, content management layer, decentralized node network.

**WHERE:** Node-based federation â€” Each domain installation is a sovereign node registered in `federation_nodes` (Federation Layer table, formerly `node_registry`) with `domain_name`, `domain_root`, and `install_url`. Optional federation via trust relationships. Single-portable PHP application runs on any PHP 8.1+ environment. Nodes are server installations, not AI agents. Federation tables (`federation_nodes`, `federation_categories`, `federation_discovery`, `federation_node_modules`) belong to the Federation Layer, not the Agent Layer.

**WHEN:** Origins (2002-2013) â€” Crafty Syntax Live Help. Absence (2014-2025) â€” 15-year gap. Return (August 2025) â€” WOLFIE initial version (222 tables). Evolution (January 2026) â€” Lupopedia 4.0.0 (111 core tables, 149 total).

**WHY:** Semantic OS design enables behavior-driven ontology, domain-neutral knowledge organization, multi-agent reasoning, federated independence, longevity without framework dependencies, and actor-centric communication.

**HOW:** Actor-based identity (`actors` table), semantic graph construction (atoms/edges from navigation), application-managed relationships (no foreign keys), BIGINT UTC timestamps (`YYYYMMDDHHIISS`), TOON file schema reference (read-only for agents), Python cron job TOON generation, Crafty Syntax as first-party module with optional content-level chat.
