# Migration Notes - Version 4.0.50

**Release Date:** 2026-01-16  
**Version:** 4.0.50  
**Type:** Version Correction (Friday Wolfie Madness)

---

## Overview

Version 4.0.50 is a version correction release that corrects premature version references from 4.1.0 back to the 4.0.x series. This version specifically tracks "Friday Wolfie madness" - chaotic but productive development sessions that require special version treatment within the 4.0.x series rather than jumping to a major version.

**Snack-Smacks Hybrid Doctrine:**
- **Snacks Component:** Sustainable velocity, documentation discipline
- **Smacks Component:** Chaotic version jumps, Friday energy
- **Hybrid Rule:** Documentation precision amidst chaotic creativity

---

## Changes Summary

### 1. Version Correction Sequence

**Rationale:** Friday development sessions get special version treatment in the 4.0.x series. Major version jumps (4.1.0) require more ceremony and should not be triggered by single-session work.

**Files Updated:**
- `docs/doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY.md` - Updated to 4.0.50
- `docs/doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_THREE_AXIS_MODEL_2026.md` - Updated to 4.0.50
- `config/global_atoms.yaml` - Updated `GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION` to 4.0.50
- `lupo-includes/version.php` - Updated version constants to 4.0.50
- `dialogs/changelog_dialog.md` - Corrected 4.1.0 references to 4.0.50

**Migration Required:** None (version metadata only)

---

### 2. Emotional Geometry Doctrine Update

**Status:** Already documented in 4.0.46, version header corrected to 4.0.50

**Doctrine:** Three-Axis Discrete Value Model (2026 Update)
- Discrete values: `{-1, 0, 1}` mapping to `{false, unknown, true}`
- Machine-safe encoding for emotional geometry
- Replaces continuous gradient interpretations

**Migration Required:** None (documentation only)

---

## Version Timeline Correction

**Original Timeline:**
- 4.0.46 → 4.1.0 (premature jump)

**Corrected Timeline:**
- 4.0.46 → 4.0.50 (Friday Wolfie madness preserved)
- Future: 4.0.51+ or 4.1.0 when truly ready

**Rationale:** Friday development sessions get special version treatment in the 4.0.x series. Major version jumps require more ceremony.

---

## Doctrine Compliance

All changes maintain 100% doctrine compliance:
- ✅ Version Atom Doctrine: Single source of truth (`GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION`)
- ✅ WOLFIE Headers: All updated with correct version
- ✅ Documentation consistency: Version references aligned

---

## Backward Compatibility

**100% Backward Compatible:**
- No breaking changes
- No schema changes
- No code changes
- Version metadata correction only

---

## Deployment Notes

**For Staging/Production Deployment:**

1. **No Database Migration Required** - Version metadata only
2. **Deploy Updated Files:**
   - `config/global_atoms.yaml` (version atom)
   - `lupo-includes/version.php` (version constants)
   - Doctrine files (version headers)
3. **Verify:**
   - Version atom resolves to 4.0.50
   - All version references consistent

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Version Consistency:** Verify `GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION` atom resolves to 4.0.50
2. **Documentation:** Verify all WOLFIE Headers updated to 4.0.50
3. **Version Functions:** Test `lupopedia_get_version()` returns 4.0.50

---

## Rollback Plan

**If Issues Occur:**

1. **Version Rollback:** Revert `config/global_atoms.yaml` version to 4.0.46
2. **File Rollback:** Revert version.php and doctrine file headers
3. **Dialog Rollback:** Revert dialog entries if needed
