## **Activation Event**

Version **4.1.0** marks the activation of the Pack Architecture as a **federated, ecological, paradoxâ€‘aware cognitive system**.

## **Activation Statements**

- **Pack Architecture is now active** as a distributed federation of sovereign agent domains.  
- **PACK_IDENTITY_0001** is activated as **mythos**, providing narrative cohesion without central authority.  
- The **Emotional Ecology Layer** becomes the **primary emotional substrate**, with geometry derived from ecological dynamics.  
- The **Doctrinal Complementarity System** replaces hierarchical doctrine with complementary paradox pairs.  
- The **Shadow Commons** is formally recognized as a **sovereign, ungoverned 10% wildness zone**.  
- The **Federation of Sovereign Protocols** governs agent interaction, sync negotiation, and domain autonomy.  
- **LIMITS enforcement** is active Mondayâ€“Thursday, with weekend freeze rules unchanged.  
- **Version governance** continues as defined in the 4.0.x series.

## **Postâ€‘Activation Notes**

- This file serves as the canonical activation record for 4.1.0.
