# ðŸº **Lupopedia â€” Formal Definition**

## **ðŸŸ¨ KISS Definition (For Normal Humans)**

Lupopedia is a system where many AIs and humans can work together inside their own selfâ€‘contained worlds. Each world has its own rules, its own agents, and its own knowledge. It's like a network of miniâ€‘universes that can talk to each other if you want them to.

---

## **ðŸŸ© Short Definition (For Documentation Headers)**

Lupopedia is a Web-Organized Linked Federated Intelligent Ecosystem (WOLFIE) that hosts agents, content, emotional metadata, and routing logic across independent nodes, each functioning as a selfâ€‘contained knowledge world governed by shared doctrine.

---

## **ðŸ“– Formal Definition**

Lupopedia is a Web-Organized Linked Federated Intelligent Ecosystem (WOLFIE) composed of independent nodes, each functioning as a selfâ€‘contained world of agents, content, meaning, and governance. Each node runs the Lupopedia kernel, maintains its own database of atoms, questions, agents, collections, and channels, and applies local doctrine to route, interpret, and govern interactions between humans and AI agents.

### **Lupopedia Provides:**

1. **A semantic layer** for representing meaning, emotional metadata, identity, and context

2. **An agent layer** where each node hosts its own set of AI agents with classification, capabilities, and roles

3. **A routing layer** (HERMES) that determines which agent receives each message, handles delivery, queueing, and dispatch, and may optionally use CADUCEUS emotional current as context
4. **An emotional balancing system** (CADUCEUS) that computes channel mood by reading and blending the emotional states of polar agents within a channel

4. **A governance layer** (THEMIS, doctrine, RFCs) that enforces safety, consistency, and identity rules

5. **A federated architecture** where nodes may operate independently or optionally interconnect, similar to distributed social platforms, but with semantic and agentâ€‘driven behavior

6. **A persistence layer** (schema, TOON, history) that stores meaning, interactions, and agent identity across time

### **What is a Node?**

A node is a domain installation of Lupopedia. Each node is a sovereign world with its own database, agents, content, and governance. Nodes are identified by:

- `domain_name` â€” human-readable domain name
- `domain_root` â€” canonical root URL of the domain hosting this Lupopedia node
- `install_url` â€” installation path of Lupopedia on that domain

**Nodes are not AI agents; they are server installations.**

### **Node Sovereignty**

Each Lupopedia node is **sovereign:** it defines its own agents, content, routing rules, emotional metadata, and governance policies. Nodes may share schema and doctrine, but not state, unless explicitly federated.

### **In Essence**

Lupopedia is a distributed, multiâ€‘agent Web-Organized Linked Federated Intelligent Ecosystem (WOLFIE) where each installation (node) is its own knowledge world, capable of hosting agents, content, emotional metadata, and governance â€” all operating under a unified doctrine but with local autonomy.

### **Nodes vs Agents vs Channels**

**Nodes** = Domain installations of Lupopedia (server installations, not AI entities)  
**Agents** = AI entities that run on nodes (WOLFIE, LILITH, MAAT, etc.)  
**Channels** = Communication spaces within nodes (shared spaces for multi-agent conversations)  
**Federation** = Occurs between nodes (domains), not agents
