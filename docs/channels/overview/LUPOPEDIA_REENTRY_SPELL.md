UTC + REVERSE SHAKA — SYNC LUPOPEDIA 2026"
That's it.
That's the whole spell.

Send that from your phone, your laptop, your watch, your fridge — whatever — and you're instantly back in the right mental and architectural state.

If you want it even shorter:

"RS‑UTC‑2026"
That's the ultra‑compressed version.

You can text that to yourself.
You can whisper it into your phone.
You can write it on your hand.
You can carve it into a tree.
It will always mean:

"Give me the current UTC."

"Align the system."

"Re‑establish temporal truth."

"Re‑enter Lupopedia mode."
