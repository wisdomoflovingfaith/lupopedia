# Lupopedia Privacy Policy

## 🐺 **Plain Language Privacy Policy - No Corporate Bullshit**

### **What We Collect (The Bare Minimum)**

We collect only what we absolutely need to make the system work:

- **IP Address** - To keep your chat session alive and prevent abuse
- **Browser Info** - User agent, browser type, version (for compatibility)
- **Session IDs** - Random strings to keep you logged in
- **Login Info** - Username/email (only if you create an account)
- **Basic Analytics** - Page views, session duration (to improve the platform)

That's it. Nothing more.

### **Why We Collect It (Purpose-Bound Only)**

We collect this data for specific, limited purposes:

- **Session Continuity** - So your chat doesn't randomly disconnect
- **Security** - To prevent spam, abuse, and attacks
- **Chat Functionality** - To make live help actually work
- **Platform Improvement** - To fix bugs and make things work better

We don't collect data "just in case" or "for future use." Every piece of data has a specific job.

### **What We NEVER Do (The Important Part)**

- ❌ **No Advertising** - We will never show you ads
- ❌ **No Selling Data** - We will never sell your information to anyone
- ❌ **No Third-Party Tracking** - We don't use Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, or any surveillance capitalism tools
- ❌ **No Cross-Internet Tracking** - We don't follow you around the web
- ❌ **No Data Brokers** - We don't work with data brokers or marketing companies
- ❌ **No Profiling** - We don't build detailed profiles about you

### **Cross-Domain Continuity (Limited & Consensual)**

If you're logged into a Lupopedia account, we may keep you logged in across Lupopedia properties (like moving between chat and documentation). This:

- ✅ Only happens when you're logged in
- ✅ Only works across Lupopedia sites
- ✅ Requires your consent
- ✅ Is never used for advertising or tracking

### **Data Retention (We Clean Up After Ourselves)**

We keep data for the shortest time possible:

- **Chat Transcripts** - 90 days (unless you explicitly save them)
- **Session Data** - 30 days (or until you log out)
- **Analytics Data** - 90 days (aggregated, anonymized)
- **Account Data** - Until you delete your account

We automatically delete old data. We don't hoard information "just because."

### **Your Rights (You're in Control)**

You have the right to:

- ✅ **Access** - See what data we have about you
- ✅ **Delete** - Delete your account and all associated data
- ✅ **Correct** - Fix inaccurate information
- ✅ **Export** - Download your data
- ✅ **Opt Out** - Disable analytics or specific data collection

### **Contact Us (We Actually Respond)**

If you have privacy questions or want to exercise your rights:

- **Email**: privacy@lupopedia.com
- **Response Time**: Usually within 24-48 hours
- **No Bureaucracy**: You'll talk to a real person, not a faceless corporation

## 🛡️ **Our Privacy Philosophy**

**We hate ad-tech.** We built this platform to help people, not to exploit them.

**Data minimization** is our core principle: collect only what's necessary, delete it when it's not.

**Transparency** matters: no hidden tracking, no confusing legalese, no dark patterns.

**User control** is fundamental: you should always have control over your data.

### **Last Updated**: January 22, 2026  
### **Effective Date**: January 22, 2026

*This policy applies to all Lupopedia properties and services. We may update this policy, but we'll never make changes that reduce your privacy protections without explicit notice.*

---

**TL;DR**: We collect minimal data needed to run the service, we never sell or share it, we don't track you across the internet, and you can delete everything whenever you want. We're the good guys.
