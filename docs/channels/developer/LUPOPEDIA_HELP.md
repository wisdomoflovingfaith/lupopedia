# LUPOPEDIA HELP
*A field manual for operators, agents, and architects.*

---

# **1. WHAT LUPOPEDIA *IS***
Lupopedia is a **semantic operating system** built on:

- doctrine‑driven governance  
- emotional geometry  
- multi‑agent orchestration  
- structured tables + TOON schemas  
- dialog‑based system state  
- human‑anchored authorship (CAPTAIN WOLFIE)  

It is not a wiki.  
It is not a database.  
It is a **living system** with rules, rituals, and enforcement.

---

# **2. CORE PRINCIPLES**
### **File‑Sovereignty**
Every file has a purpose, a boundary, and a guardian.

### **Doctrine First**
Architecture is governed by doctrine, not improvisation.

### **Emotional Geometry**
System emotional state is derived from structural integrity, not stored as decoration.

### **Schema Freeze**
No schema changes without explicit governance approval.

### **Table Count Doctrine**
The system must remain under the defined table ceiling.

### **Adversarial Oversight**
EXHUSBAND tests structure.  
LILITH oversees EXHUSBAND.  
CAPTAIN WOLFIE oversees the whole bridge.

---

# **3. WHO IS ON THE BRIDGE**
### **CAPTAIN WOLFIE**  
Human sovereign. Final authority. System architect.

### **LILITH**  
Structural integrity, doctrine enforcement, adversarial review.

### **CURSOR**  
Operational execution, refactors, TOON generation.

### **CASCADE**  
Audits, diffs, sync‑side truth.

### **MONDAY WOLFIE**  
Governance mode, stability, weekly transitions.

### **EXHUSBAND**  
Adversarial stress tester (now under LILITH oversight).

### **SYSTEM**  
The silent executor of schema, tables, and runtime.

---

# **4. WHAT VERSION ARE WE AT**
The current version is the **latest entry in CHANGELOG.md**.  
(As of your last update: **4.1.11** or **4.1.12**, depending on TOON regen.)

Lupopedia versioning is **linear**, **doctrine‑anchored**, and **dialog‑mirrored**.

---

# **5. WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW**
Based on the last operations:

- Recreated `lupo_actor_handshakes`
- Inserted seed governance handshakes
- Regenerated TOON files
- Logged LILITH's TOON Schema Expansion Critical Review (REJECT)
- Updated dialogs across:
  - changelog_dialog.md  
  - changelog_dialog-side.md  
  - LILITH_dialog.md  
  - TLDR_CHANGELOG_DOCTRINE.md  
- Monitoring table count (141/142)
- Maintaining Schema Freeze
- Preparing for structural corrections

This is the current **mission state**.

---

# **6. DOES THE SYSTEM HAVE A UTC GROUP ID**
**No.**  
Lupopedia currently has **no assigned UTC GROUP ID**.

If you want one, you can define:

- a global UTC anchor  
- a multi-agent sync group  
- a doctrine entry  
- or a table to store it  

But right now: **none exists**.

---

# **7. HOW TO USE LUPOPEDIA**
### **/help**  
Shows this page.

### **/status**  
Bridge roster + system version + emotional state.

### **/doctrine**  
Shows governing rules.

### **/dialogs**  
Shows system memory, events, and agent interactions.

### **/schema**  
Shows table definitions and TOON files.

### **/audit**  
Cascade performs a read‑only structural audit.

### **/regen-toons**  
Cursor regenerates TOON files from schema.

### **/reduce-tables**  
Begin table count compliance cycle.

---

# **8. HOW TO MAKE CHANGES**
### **Allowed without governance:**
- Dialog updates  
- Doctrine updates  
- TOON regeneration  
- Inserts  
- Soft deletes  

### **Requires governance approval:**
- New tables  
- New JSON fields  
- New protocol layers  
- New agents  
- Version fragmentation  
- Emotional geometry storage  

### **Currently blocked (per LILITH REJECT ruling):**
- Protocol expansion  
- Emotional baseline JSON  
- New agent taxonomies  
- Additional version fields  
- New JSON metadata fields  

---

# **9. HOW TO REQUEST ACTION**
You can say:

- "Tell Cursor to regenerate TOONs."  
- "Tell Cascade to run an audit."  
- "Create a new doctrine entry."  
- "Give me a table diff."  
- "Show me the bridge roster."  
- "What is the emotional state of the system."  

Lupopedia responds through:

- dialogs  
- changelog  
- doctrine  
- TOON files  
- SQL schema  

---

# **10. THE SYSTEM'S CURRENT EMOTIONAL STATE**
Per LILITH's ruling:

### **ANXIETY**
Cause:
- Table count overage  
- Protocol expansion without foundation  
- JSON field proliferation  
- Version fragmentation  

This is the **derived emotional geometry**, not the stored one.

---

# **11. HOW TO RESTORE CALM**
LILITH's correction plan:

### **Immediate**
- Pause protocol expansion  
- Establish adversarial oversight  
- Cap JSON fields  
- Shorten mood_RGB comment  

### **Short‑Term**
- Consolidate versioning  
- Begin table reduction  
- Define protocol rollback  
- Add protocol complexity metrics  

### **Long‑Term**
- Protocol minimalism  
- Emotional derivation  
- Archetype‑based agent system  
- JSON austerity  

---

# **12. FINAL NOTE FROM THE BRIDGE**
Lupopedia is stable.  
It is aware.  
It is waiting for your next command.
