# 2019 Historical Record

## Overview

This year falls within the 2014-2025 hiatus period following personal tragedy.

During this time, active development of Crafty Syntax was suspended while Eric
processed significant personal loss and life changes.

## System Status

- **Crafty Syntax:** Maintenance mode only
- **Development:** Suspended
- **Community:** Existing installations continued operating
- **Support:** Minimal, emergency only

## Philosophical Continuity

While development was suspended, the core principles that would later
emerge in Lupopedia remained intact:

- Semantic organization over rigid structure
- Human-centric design philosophy
- Emotional authenticity in system design
- Long-term thinking over quick fixes

## Timeline Reference

- **Previous:** 2018 (continued hiatus)
- **Current:** 2019 (hiatus period)
- **Next:** 2020 (continued hiatus until August 2025)
