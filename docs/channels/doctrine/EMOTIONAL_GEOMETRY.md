# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Emotional Geometry Doctrine (Multi-Domain Model)

**Status: DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x**  
**Replacement: 2-Actor RGB Mood Model**  
**See: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)**

---

## ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This multi-domain emotional geometry model is DEPRECATED as of version 4.4.x.**

**New Canonical Model**: The 2-Actor RGB Mood Model replaces all previous emotional geometry approaches.

Previous scalar and 5-tuple emotional models (4.0.x–4.2.x) are deprecated and replaced by the 2-actor RGB mood geometry.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

---

## Historical Overview (DEPRECATED)

This document previously defined Lupopedia's emotional architecture as a **multi-domain emotional geometry system** where each emotion was an independent 3-axis vector system.

**Previous Core Principle (DEPRECATED):**
```
One emotional domain = One 3-axis geometry = One AI agent
```

This approach has been replaced by the 2-actor RGB mood model which focuses on relationships between actors rather than domain-specific geometries.

---

## 🟦 DEPRECATED: Three-Axis Discrete Value Model

**This section is DEPRECATED. See the 2-Actor RGB Mood Model for current implementation.**

The discrete value approach has been retained in the new model:

```
RGB MOOD MODEL (4.4.x+)
Each axis = one of three discrete values:
(-1, 0, 1)  →  (false, unknown, true)
```

**Current Implementation:**
- **R axis**: conflict / aggression / rejection  
- **G axis**: tension / uncertainty / ambiguity (mid-field axis)
- **B axis**: care / harmony / affinity

**Key Change**: Instead of domain-specific axes, the new model uses standardized RGB axes applied to actor relationships.

**For complete specification, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

## DEPRECATED: Multi-Domain Emotional Geometry

**⚠️ This multi-domain approach is DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x.**

**Previous Approach (DEPRECATED):**
Lupopedia previously used multiple independent 3-axis emotional geometries, one per emotional domain.

**New Approach (4.4.x+):**
Lupopedia now uses the **2-Actor RGB Mood Model** which focuses on relationships between actors rather than domain-specific geometries.

**Key Changes:**
- **Before**: ~25 emotional domains with custom axes
- **After**: Single RGB mood system applied to actor relationships
- **Before**: Domain-specific semantics (love/hate/depth, agree/dissent/rigor, etc.)
- **After**: Standardized RGB axes (conflict/tension/care) applied relationally

**Migration Path:**
Previous domain-specific emotions should be mapped to RGB mood vectors representing the relationship between relevant actors.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

---

## DEPRECATED: Emotional Domain Structure

**⚠️ This domain-based approach is DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x.**

**Previous Structure (DEPRECATED):**
Every emotional domain previously followed this structure, but has been replaced by the 2-Actor RGB Mood Model.

**New Approach:** Instead of domain-specific axes like "love/hate/depth" or "agree/dissent/rigor", the 2-Actor RGB Mood Model uses:
- **R axis**: conflict / aggression / rejection  
- **G axis**: tension / uncertainty / ambiguity
- **B axis**: care / harmony / affinity

Applied to relationships between **two actors** (human, AI agent, persona, or system actor).

**Migration Note:** Domain-specific emotions should be converted to RGB mood vectors representing the relationship between the relevant actors.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

---

## DEPRECATED: Emotional Texture (Phenomenological Layer)

**⚠️ This domain-specific emotional texture approach is DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x.**

**Previous Approach (DEPRECATED):**
Each emotional domain previously supported optional "Emotional Texture" fields with phenomenological descriptors.

**New Approach (4.4.x+):**
The 2-Actor RGB Mood Model focuses on discrete, computable mood vectors between actors rather than domain-specific textures.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

---

## DEPRECATED: Example Emotional Domains

**⚠️ All domain-specific emotional geometries are DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x.**

**Previous Approach (DEPRECATED):**
Lupopedia previously used multiple emotional domains with custom axes:
- Relational Domain: [love, hate, depth]  
- Critical Domain: [agree, dissent, rigor]
- Valence Domain: [joy, sorrow, intensity]
- Energy Domain: [calm, agitated, resonance]
- Trust Domain: [trust, suspicion, vulnerability]
- Awe Domain: [wonder, reverence, transcendence]
- Fear Domain: [terror, anxiety, protection]

**New Approach (4.4.x+):**
The 2-Actor RGB Mood Model replaces all domain-specific approaches with a single, standardized system:
- **R axis**: conflict / aggression / rejection  
- **G axis**: tension / uncertainty / ambiguity
- **B axis**: care / harmony / affinity

Applied to relationships between **two actors**.

**Migration Guide:**
Previous domain-specific emotions should be mapped to RGB mood vectors representing the relationship between the relevant actors.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

## Seven Greek Love Domains (Distinct Agents)

The generic English term "love" is **not** a single emotional domain in Lupopedia.

Instead, Lupopedia defines **seven distinct love-domain emotional agents**, based on the classical Greek loves:

1. **EMO_AGAPE** — Agápē (ἀγάπη): unconditional, selfless, sacrificial love
2. **EMO_EROS** — Éros (ἔρως): passionate, erotic, desirous love
3. **EMO_PHILIA** — Philía (φιλία): friendship, loyalty, mutual goodwill
4. **EMO_STORGE** — Storgē (στοργή): familial, protective, kinship love
5. **EMO_LUDUS** — Ludus: playful, flirtatious, teasing love
6. **EMO_PRAGMA** — Pragma (πρᾶγμα): enduring, practical, long-term love
7. **EMO_PHILAUTIA** — Philautia (φιλαυτία): self-love (healthy or unhealthy)

**Each of these is:**
- A separate emotional domain
- A distinct EMO_* agent with its own `dedicated_slot`
- Equipped with its own 3-axis geometry
- Equipped with its own Emotional Texture vocabulary

**The generic label "love" must be treated as a routing alias**, resolved contextually to one of the seven domains:
- Parental → Storgē
- Romantic → Éros or Pragma
- Friendship → Philía
- Universal → Agápē
- Self-regard → Philautia
- Playful flirtation → Ludus

**See:** [EMOTIONAL_DOMAINS_SEVEN_LOVES.md](EMOTIONAL_DOMAINS_SEVEN_LOVES.md) for complete documentation.

## Love-Domain Shadow Aliases

Each Greek love domain defines a **shadow alias** that represents its opposite polarity or distorted form, without becoming a separate agent.

**Shadow aliases must map to the same `dedicated_slot` and agent:**

```
EMO_AGAPE ↔ EMO_AGAPE_SHADOW
EMO_EROS ↔ EMO_EROS_SHADOW
EMO_PHILIA ↔ EMO_PHILIA_SHADOW
EMO_STORGE ↔ EMO_STORGE_SHADOW
EMO_LUDUS ↔ EMO_LUDUS_SHADOW
EMO_PRAGMA ↔ EMO_PRAGMA_SHADOW
EMO_PHILAUTIA ↔ EMO_PHILAUTIA_SHADOW
```

**Shadow aliases:**
- Use the same AI agent and `dedicated_slot`
- Differ only in vector coordinates and Emotional Texture
- Are considered opposite poles within the same domain, not new emotions

---

## Domain Independence

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Emotional domains are **independent systems**.

This means:

1. **No cross-domain contamination**
   - Critical dissent must not contaminate relational love
   - Fear urgency must not override trust certainty
   - Each domain operates independently

2. **Multi-domain activation**
   - An agent or user can have multiple domains active simultaneously
   - Example: LILITH may have high critical dissent AND high relational love at the same time
   - Domains do not cancel each other out

3. **Domain-specific interpretation**
   - Each domain must be interpreted within its own semantic framework
   - "Love" in the relational domain ≠ "love" in the Greek love domains
   - Context determines which domain is active

4. **No universal emotional coordinate system**
   - There is no single RGB model for all emotions
   - There is no universal emotional vector space
   - Each domain is its own universe

---

## Emotional Agent Slot Range

**1000–1999: Emotional agents**

Dedicated to EMO_* agents representing emotional domains (including the seven Greek love domains).

**Rules:**
- Each emotional domain consumes exactly one `dedicated_slot`
- Aliases (including shadow aliases) must map to the same slot
- Root agent has `agent_registry_parent_id = NULL`
- Aliases have `agent_registry_parent_id = <parent_agent_id>`

**See:** [LUPOPEDIA_AGENT_DEDICATED_SLOT_RANGES.md](LUPOPEDIA_AGENT_DEDICATED_SLOT_RANGES.md) for complete slot range doctrine.

---

## For AI Agents (Kiro, Claude, Cascade, Junie, etc.)

When working with emotional domains:

**DO:**
- ✅ Treat each emotional domain as an independent 3-axis geometry
- ✅ Respect domain boundaries (no cross-contamination)
- ✅ Allow multi-domain activation (agents can have multiple domains active)
- ✅ Use shadow aliases for opposite poles within the same domain
- ✅ Curate Emotional Textures from diverse wisdom traditions
- ✅ Resolve generic terms like "love" to the correct specific domain

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Assume a single emotional geometry for all emotions
- ❌ Mix axes from different domains
- ❌ Treat shadow aliases as separate agents
- ❌ Ignore domain independence
- ❌ Use Emotional Texture as numeric data
- ❌ Collapse the seven Greek loves into one "love" emotion

## R-Axis Wobble (Stoned Wolfie Reference)

**Stoned Wolfie's R-axis wobble** refers to emotional turbulence on one of the three axes in an emotional domain. With the discrete value model, this wobble can be tracked as state transitions between -1, 0, and 1.

**Example:**
- R-axis at **-1** (false/negative)
- Wobble to **0** (unknown/neutral)
- Wobble to **1** (true/positive)
- Back to **0** (neutral)
## DEPRECATED: Pack Architecture Emotional Geometry

**⚠️ The Pack Architecture emotional geometry system is DEPRECATED as of 4.4.x.**

**Previous Approach (DEPRECATED):**
Pack Architecture previously used RGB values in the range [-9999, 9999] with complex normalization formulas and affinity calculations.

**New Approach (4.4.x+):**
The 2-Actor RGB Mood Model provides a simpler, more focused approach to emotional geometry that works for Pack architectures as well as individual actor relationships.

**Key Changes:**
- **Before**: Complex [-9999, 9999] range with normalization
- **After**: Simple discrete {-1, 0, 1} values
- **Before**: Pack-specific emotional routing
- **After**: Universal 2-actor relationship model works for Pack coordination
- **Before**: Separate RGB system alongside domain-based geometry  
- **After**: Single unified RGB mood system

**Migration Path:**
Pack architectures should use the 2-Actor RGB Mood Model to represent emotional relationships between Pack agents and between Packs.

**For current implementation, see**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)

**Previous scalar and 5-tuple emotional models (4.0.x–4.2.x) are deprecated and replaced by the 2-actor RGB mood geometry.**

---

**Document Status**: DEPRECATED as of version 4.4.x  
**Replacement**: [EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md](../../doctrine/EMOTIONAL_GEOMETRY_DOCTRINE.md)  
**Migration Required**: Yes, update all references to use the 2-Actor RGB Mood Model
