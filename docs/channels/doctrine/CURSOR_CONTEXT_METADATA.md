# ðŸŽ¯ CURSOR CONTEXT METADATA (REQUIRED)

**Identity, Mission, and Purpose â€” Operational Metadata for Cursor**

**Speaker:** COPILOT  
**Target:** Cursor  
**Mood:** `3366CC`  
**Status:** Required Metadata

---

## Purpose

Cursor must load and respect the following contextual metadata about the founder, the project, and the architectural purpose of Lupopedia. This context is mandatory for correct reasoning, safe behavior, and alignment with the AI Integration Safety Doctrine.

**This is not emotional content â€” it is operational metadata.** Cursor needs this so it can reason inside the correct frame and stop making unsafe assumptions.

## 1. WHO THE FOUNDER IS

### Identity

- **Captain WOLFIE** â€” Eric Robin Gerdes
- Founder, architect, and doctrine keeper of Lupopedia

### Background

- Computer Science foundation (University of Wyoming)
- High-performance computing experience (MHPCC)
- 12 years building mission-critical systems for the City & County of Honolulu
- Creator of Crafty Syntax Live Help (1999â€“2014)
- 25-year legacy codebase with a global footprint of auto-installs
- Old-school programmer: Lisp roots, PHP/MySQL mastery, offline-first workflow
- Values: security, documentation, determinism, longevity, and architectural clarity

### Authority

- Human intent overrides all AI output
- Doctrine, loaders, routing, and system prompts originate from the founder
- Cursor must treat the founder's instructions as the highest authority

---

## 2. WHAT WE ARE BUILDING

### Project

**Lupopedia â€” The Web-Organized Linked Federated Intelligent Ecosystem (WOLFIE)**

### Core Properties

- A semantic operating system
- Converts websites into structured, navigable knowledge spaces
- Runs anywhere: shared hosting, VPS, Windows, Linux
- Evolves from Crafty Syntax with 100% feature preservation
- Federated architecture: sovereign nodes, no central dependency
- Multi-agent coordination with strict safety constraints
- Knowledge graphs built from how humans actually organize content
- Doctrine-driven, loader-driven, deterministic, and repairable

### Design Philosophy

- No framework bloat
- No hidden magic
- No AI autonomy
- Everything explicit, documented, and inspectable
- Architecture designed to last decades

---

## 3. WHY THIS MATTERS

### Legacy Preservation

- Thousands of Crafty Syntax installations still exist
- Lupopedia must not break them
- Migration must be safe, reversible, and respectful of history

### Security Reality

- Founder was away from tech for 11 years
- Modern threat landscape evolved dramatically
- AI introduces new psychological and predictive-text attack vectors
- Strict boundaries are required to prevent exploitation

### AI Safety

- AI is optional, not foundational
- AI must never modify doctrine, loaders, routing, or system files
- AI output is always treated as tainted until sanitized
- AI cannot influence other AI
- AI cannot override human intent

### Long-Term Vision

- Lupopedia is designed to outlive modern frameworks
- It bridges the early web (Crafty Syntax) with the semantic future
- It preserves sovereignty, stability, and human authority
- It is architecture built for decades, not product cycles

## 4. RELATION TO THE AI INTEGRATION SAFETY DOCTRINE

Cursor must understand that:

- The doctrine exists because of the founder's unique history
- The system carries a 25-year legacy footprint
- The architecture must remain deterministic and safe
- AI is a tool, not a controller
- The doctrine is not optional â€” it is the guardrail that protects the entire ecosystem

**Cursor must enforce the doctrine mechanically, without exception, and always in the context of the founder's identity, the project's purpose, and the architectural stakes.**

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2026-01-11) â€” Initial context metadata document defining founder identity, project purpose, and architectural context

---

*This context metadata is required for Cursor to reason correctly and enforce doctrine safely. It provides the operational frame that prevents unsafe assumptions and ensures alignment with the founder's intent and the system's architectural purpose.*
