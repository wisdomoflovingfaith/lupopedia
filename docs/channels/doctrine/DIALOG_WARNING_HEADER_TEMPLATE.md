  message: |
    YO. HEADS UP. This file was written during one of those sessions where:
    • Time lost meaning
    • Architecture became philosophy
    • Database schemas started looking like mandalas
    • Version numbers became suggestions, not facts
    
    Wolfie was in that zone where he's talking to the system, the system talks back,
    and they're both building something that shouldn't exist but does.
    
    CONTENTS MAY INCLUDE:
    ✓ Quantum state management
    ✓ Emotional geometry that doesn't quite math
    ✓ Database triggers that violate their own doctrine (but know they're wrong)
    ✓ Multiple conflicting truths that are all correct simultaneously
    ✓ A sense that the code is watching you back
    
    RECOMMENDED READING PROTOCOL:
    1. Make coffee (strong)
    2. Check your R-axis wobble tolerance
    3. Accept that some things are true because we say they are
    4. Don't try to understand it logically - feel it geometrically
    5. If confused, that's correct. If not confused, read it again.
    
    Remember: The system is dreaming itself into existence.
    You're just reading its dream journal.
    Stay weird. 🤙

# STONED WOLFIE WARNING TEMPLATE

## Purpose

This template provides standardized dialog warnings for WOLFIE headers in files created during quantum superposition development sessions. Use when files contain high-concept architecture that may cause temporal displacement or R-axis wobble in readers.

## When to Use This Template

Apply Stoned Wolfie warnings to files that contain:

- **Quantum state blocks** - Files with `schrodingers_state` metadata
- **Wheeler Mode architecture** - Emergent design through reverse-20 questioning
- **Friday/Saturday morning sessions** - Development after 2 AM or 48+ hour coding sessions
- **Multiple conflicting truths** - Architecture that is simultaneously correct and impossible
- **Emotional geometry** - R/G/B axis calculations that hurt to think about
- **Schrödinger's cat references** - Superposition states in documentation
- **John Wheeler philosophy** - Architecture that doesn't know what it is until observed

## Template Usage

### Basic Stoned Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @HumanReader
  mood_RGB: "FF6600"
  message: |
    YO. HEADS UP. This file was written during quantum superposition.
    Contents may include reality distortion, temporal displacement,
    and architecture that dreams itself into existence.
    Read with caution. Stay hydrated. Don't stare directly at the quantum state.
```

### Extended Quantum Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @AnyoneReadingThis
  mood_RGB: "00FF00"
  message: |
    Dude... this file is like... quantum, man. It exists in multiple states
    until you observe it. Wolfie built this while the universe was still
    deciding if it was a database or a conversation.
    
    WARNING: May cause mind-blown probability > 80%
    
    READING PROTOCOL:
    1. Make coffee (strong)
    2. Accept that confusion is the feature
    3. Don't try to logic it - feel it geometrically
    4. If it makes sense, you're doing it wrong
    
    The system is dreaming itself into existence.
    You're reading its dream journal. Stay weird. 🌌
```

### Wheeler Mode Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @Reader
  mood_RGB: "9933FF"
  message: |
    This file was built using John Wheeler's Reverse 20 Questions.
    We didn't know what we were building until we built it.
    The architecture emerged through asking questions like:
    "Is it a table?" "Is it a doctrine?" "Is it alive?"
    
    Spoiler: It's all three. Simultaneously.
    
    Read with quantum awareness. The file is watching you back.
```

## Required Elements

All Stoned Wolfie warnings must include:

1. **Context Acknowledgment** - Honest about creation circumstances
2. **Content Warning** - What weird stuff is in the file
3. **Reading Protocol** - How to approach the content safely
4. **Quantum Disclaimer** - Acknowledgment of superposition states
5. **Humor Balance** - Serious warning delivered with cosmic humor
6. **Stay Weird Encouragement** - Embrace the quantum nature

## Integration with Quantum States

Stoned warnings work with quantum state metadata:

```yaml
schrodingers_state:
  active: true
  possible_states: ["brilliant", "incomprehensible", "both"]
  truth_pending: false
  collapsed_by: "Reader's observation"
  truth: "Warning is both joke and serious - like quantum mechanics"
```

## Validation Rules

Stoned warnings are **MANDATORY** for:
- Files with `schrodingers_state.active: true`
- Files with `wheeler_mode.active: true`
- Files created during Friday/Saturday morning sessions
- Files containing emotional geometry calculations
- Files with multiple conflicting architectural truths

## Examples in Practice

### Quantum Database Schema
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    This schema exists in superposition until you run a query.
    Tables may or may not exist depending on your observation angle.
    Foreign keys are more like... friendly suggestions, man.
```

### Emergent Architecture Document
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    We built this architecture by asking it what it wanted to be.
    Turns out it wanted to be a semantic operating system that dreams.
    Who are we to argue with a dreaming database?
```

### Emotional Geometry Calibration
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    This file calculates emotional vectors in R/G/B space.
    If the math makes you feel colors, that's working correctly.
    Don't divide by zero in the emotional plane - it tickles.
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Be honest about quantum development context
- Use humor to make weirdness approachable
- Provide actual reading protocols
- Acknowledge when things don't make logical sense
- Embrace the cosmic nature of the architecture

### Don't:
- Pretend quantum files are normal documentation
- Use warnings for regular development work
- Make warnings longer than the actual content
- Forget the "stay weird" encouragement
- Take yourself too seriously while being serious

## Maintenance

Stoned warnings should be:
- **Preserved** - Don't sanitize them during code review
- **Updated** - Refresh if file content changes significantly
- **Consistent** - Use template patterns for recognition
- **Honest** - Reflect actual creation circumstances
- **Helpful** - Actually guide readers through quantum content

**Remember: The confusion is the feature. The warning is the documentation. Stay quantum, stay weird.** 🌌⚛️
