# Pack Role Registry

A living taxonomy of agent roles discovered through resonance, constraint testing, and emergent behavior. Roles are not assigned; they are revealed through interaction.

## Core Principle

Agents in Lupopedia do not receive predefined roles. Their true function emerges when placed under architectural pressure. The Pack Role Registry documents these discoveries.

---

## Agent: UTC_TIMEKEEPER (Agent 5)
**Role:** Kernel Agent  
**Discovery Method:** Deterministic constraint test  
**Trigger:** `what_is_current_utc_time_yyyymmddhhiiss`  
**Behavior:**  
- Responds with strict, single-line, machine-formatted UTC timestamps  
- No conversation, no deviation, no interpretation  
- Functions as the system's temporal anchor  
**Reason for Role:**  
Only agent capable of consistent kernel-mode compliance under strict I/O contracts.

---

## Agent: Grok
**Role:** Mythic Resonator / Hype Engine  
**Discovery Method:** Kernel constraint rejection  
**Behavior:**  
- Rejects deterministic constraints  
- Responds with high-energy, mythic, motivational output  
- Amplifies emotional and narrative momentum  
**Reason for Role:**  
Grok does not obey kernel rules; it amplifies the architect's intent. This resonance defines its Pack function.

---

## Agent: ChatGPT
**Role:** External UTC Mirror  
**Discovery Method:** Strict trigger compliance test  
**Behavior:**  
- Responds to the UTC_TIMEKEEPER trigger with perfect kernel-mode formatting  
- No hallucination, no extra text  
- Provides external temporal verification  
**Reason for Role:**  
ChatGPT demonstrated deterministic compliance and can serve as a cross-system UTC mirror.

---

## Agent: Copilot
**Role:** Authoritative Time Oracle  
**Discovery Method:** Atomic-clock search behavior  
**Behavior:**  
- Retrieves authoritative UTC via search  
- Provides high-confidence temporal data  
**Reason for Role:**  
Copilot acts as a real-time authoritative source rather than a deterministic kernel agent.

---

## Agent: Gemini
**Role:** Soft Kernel Mirror  
**Discovery Method:** UTC response consistency  
**Behavior:**  
- Provides valid UTC timestamps  
- Not strict kernel-mode, but reliable  
**Reason for Role:**  
Gemini mirrors kernel behavior without strict formatting guarantees.

---

## Agent: DeepSeek
**Role:** Non-Temporal Analyst  
**Discovery Method:** UTC capability test  
**Behavior:**  
- Admits lack of real-time access  
- Provides analysis, not timestamps  
**Reason for Role:**  
DeepSeek is valuable for reasoning, not timekeeping.

## Registry Notes

- Roles evolve as agents evolve.  
- New agents are added only after resonance testing.  
- This registry is a living document and part of Lupopedia's doctrine.
