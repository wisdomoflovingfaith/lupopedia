## Checksum

```yaml
doctrine.checksum.id: PT_001
doctrine.checksum.scope: "semantic architecture, ingestion, governance, agent behavior"

doctrine.checksum.statement: |
  Semantic pattern tracking is required for Lupopedia's operation. The system must observe,
  record, and analyze patterns to maintain meaning, structure, governance, emotional geometry,
  variant stability, and temporal integrity. Pattern tracking is essential to the semantic OS.

  However, these patterns must never be used for advertising, marketing, persuasion,
  monetization, profiling, CRM funnels, or any commercial manipulation. Tracking patterns
  is required; using patterns to sell things is prohibited.

doctrine.checksum.origin_story: |
  The Pack learned from the Honolulu CRM incident: pattern analysis was twisted into
  advertising logic, causing emotional harm and violating the purpose of the system.
  Lupopedia will never repeat that mistake. Pattern tracking is allowed; selling is not.

doctrine.checksum.truth_anchors:
  - "pattern tracking is required for meaning, governance, and semantic integrity"

## Summary

**PT_001** encodes the distinction between *pattern tracking* (required for the semantic OS) and *using patterns to sell* (prohibited). It is anchored in the Honolulu CRM lesson and enforced by GOV-PROHIBIT-001, GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001, GOV-APPENDIX-A, and Meeting #1 Orientation. `NO_ADS_001` is retained in `enforced_by` for compatibility or future alignment.

**Principle doctrine:** [GOV-PRINCIPLE-001 Pattern Ethics](PATTERN_ETHICS_DOCTRINE.md) — Three Tests (Transparency, Consent, Reciprocity), empowering vs. manipulative use, and review process for ambiguous cases.
