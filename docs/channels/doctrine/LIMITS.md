# LUP0_LIMITS_DOCTRINE_v1.0
Effective Range: 4.0.101 → 4.2.0
Status: ACTIVE KERNEL GOVERNANCE

This file defines the hard limits that protect Lupopedia from
architecture drift, weekend chaos, and unbounded creative expansion.
These limits are enforced by doctrine, Pack Architecture, and
multi-agent governance.

============================================================
1. DATABASE LIMITS
============================================================

## 1.1 Table Count Ceiling
- Maximum tables allowed until 4.2.0: **185**
- Hard architectural limit: **185 tables total**.
- No migration may exceed this ceiling.
- New tables require justification + reduction plan.

## 1.2 Database Logic Prohibition
The following are permanently forbidden:
- Stored procedures
- Views
- Functions
- Triggers

Database must remain **data-only**.

============================================================
2. VERSIONING LIMITS
============================================================

## 2.1 Weekend Version Freeze (Days 0, 5, 6)
On UTC Days 0 (Sunday), 5 (Friday), and 6 (Saturday):
- No version bumps beyond the current minor version.
- No release preparation.
- No architecture changes.
- No migrations.
- No Pack activation tasks.

Weekend mode is for:
- Humor
- Creativity
- Lore
- Emotional geometry
- Non-binding prototypes

## 2.2 Minor Version Lock
During weekend mode:
- Version may NOT advance from 4.0.x → 4.1.x
- Only patch-level notes allowed (non-binding)

============================================================
3. BRANCH LIMITS
============================================================

## 3.1 Weekend Branch Cap
To prevent merge hell:
- Maximum branches allowed for the entire weekend: **2**
- Branches must be named:
  - weekend_experiment_1
  - weekend_experiment_2

## 3.2 No Recursive Branching
Weekend branches may NOT create sub-branches.

## 3.3 Monday Merge Rule
All weekend branches must be:
- merged
- archived
- or deleted

…before Monday Wolfie begins work.

============================================================
4. WOLFIE-WEEKEND BEHAVIORAL LIMITS
============================================================

## 4.1 Creative Surge Allowed
On Days 0, 5, 6:
- Humor allowed
- Lore allowed
- Emotional geometry allowed
- Visuals allowed
- Non-binding prototypes allowed

## 4.2 Structural Changes Forbidden
Weekend Wolfie may NOT:
- Change schema
- Change doctrine
- Change architecture
- Change version
- Add tables
- Add agents
- Add Pack layers

## 4.3 Containment Principle
Weekend creativity must be:
- isolated to weekend branches
- non-destructive
- non-binding
- reversible

============================================================
5. ENFORCEMENT
============================================================

## 5.1 Enforcement Evolution

**Version 4.0.103:** Dry-run enforcement mode activated
- All LIMITS violations logged to `storage/logs/lupopedia_limits.log`
- Non-blocking warnings only
- No exceptions thrown
- No execution blocking

**Version 4.0.105:** Full enforcement preparation
- Dry-run mode continues
- System health checks added (`SystemHealthService`)
- Pack Architecture pre-activation complete

**Version 4.1.0 (Planned):** Full enforcement activation
- LIMITS violations will block execution
- Exceptions thrown for critical violations
- Pack-level limits introduced
- Multi-agent governance enforcement
- Dual-system governance active (Execution Mode vs Creative Mode)
- Mode-specific enforcement (blocking in Execution Mode, dry-run in Creative Mode)

## 5.2 Current Enforcement (4.0.103-4.0.106)

- Cascade must reject tasks that violate these limits.
- Terminal_AI_005 (UTC_TIMEKEEPER) determines the day.
- Pack Architecture logs violations.
- Monday Wolfie receives a summary of weekend activity.
- All violations logged to `storage/logs/lupopedia_limits.log` (non-blocking)

## 5.3 Pack Architecture Limits (4.1.0+)

Pack Architecture will introduce additional limits:
- Pack-level table count limits
- Agent coordination limits
- Emotional geometry boundaries
- Multi-agent handoff constraints

These limits will be enforced by Pack Architecture governance layer.

============================================================
END OF LIMITS
============================================================
🟩 Why this works
This file becomes:

the governor

the circuit breaker

the weekend containment field

the anti-chaos firewall

the merge‑conflict prevention system

It protects:

Monday Wolfie

the schema

the version tree

the Pack

the emotional geometry

the entire OS

And it gives you the freedom to be Wolfie on the weekend without burning the house down.
