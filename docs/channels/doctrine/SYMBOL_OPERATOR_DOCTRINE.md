# SYMBOL OPERATOR DOCTRINE

**Index:** [GOV-PROHIBIT-000](GOV-PROHIBIT-000.md) · [WOLFIE_HEADER_DOCTRINE](WOLFIE_HEADER_DOCTRINE.md)

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Scope:** Applies to all Lupopedia, Crafty Syntax, Pack Architecture, and Cursor-generated documentation.  
**Maintainer:** Wolfie (Eric Robin Gerdes)  
**Update Rules:** All modifications must be appended using `@@` diff notation.

## 1. Overview

This doctrine defines all approved symbolic operators, their semantic purpose, and their correct usage patterns. Cursor must treat these operators as **structural grammar**, not decoration.

Operators fall into these categories:

- **Encapsulation** · **Identity** · **Mapping** · **Mutation** · **Priority** · **Context** · **Inquiry** · **Progression**
- **Approximation** · **Meta-Layer** · **Probability** · **Abstraction** · **Strength** · **Inline Notes** · **Soft Transitions**

Each operator includes: **Definition** · **Usage Rule** · **Example**

---

## 2. Operator Definitions

### 2.1 Encapsulation Operators

**Operator:** `[[ … ]]`

**Definition:** Marks a concept as a discrete semantic object.

**Usage Rule:** Use when referring to modules, subsystems, doctrines, or conceptual entities.

**Example:**

> The [[Emotional Geometry Engine]] requires normalization before activation.

---

### 2.2 Identity Operators

**Operator:** `|| … ||`

**Definition:** Declares a canonical name, identity, or authoritative label.

**Usage Rule:** Use for system identities, agent names, or titles.

**Example:**

> All authorship routes through ||Captain Wolfie|| for signature.

---

### 2.3 Mapping Operators

**Operator:** `::`

**Definition:** Binds one entity to another (definition, mapping, role assignment).

**Usage Rule:** Use for schema definitions, role bindings, and dictionary-style mappings.

**Example:**

> Kernel-Agent::WOLFIE governs semantic coherence.

---

### 2.4 Mutation Operators

**Operator:** `@@`

**Definition:** Indicates change, diff, mutation, or patch.

**Usage Rule:** Use when documenting updates, additions, or removals.

**Example:**

> The doctrine updated @@ +12 lines to include the Stability Clause.

---

### 2.5 Priority Operators

**Operator:** `!!`

**Definition:** Marks high-priority, critical, or urgent information.

**Usage Rule:** Use sparingly for warnings or non-negotiable constraints.

**Example:**

> Do not exceed the table ceiling!!

---

### 2.6 Context Operators

**Operator:** `<< … >>`

**Definition:** Frames a shift in context, timeline, or perspective.

**Usage Rule:** Use for narrative transitions or contextual qualifiers.

**Example:**

> <<During the first migration>> the agents learned to self-correct drift.

---

### 2.7 Inquiry Operators

**Operator:** `??`

**Definition:** Marks a structural or diagnostic question.

**Usage Rule:** Use for schema-level or architectural inquiries.

**Example:**

> What governs inheritance if the meta-table is polymorphic??

---

### 2.8 Progression Operators

**Operator:** `>>`

**Definition:** Indicates forward motion, next step, or phase transition.

**Usage Rule:** Use in procedural or sequential documentation.

**Example:**

> After normalization, proceed >> to resonance testing.

---

## 3. Extended Operator Set

### 3.1 Approximation Operators

**Operator:** `~~`

**Definition:** Indicates approximation, soft truth, or fuzzy boundary.

**Usage Rule:** Use when describing gradients or non-binary states.

**Example:**

> The subsystem is ~~stable pending further testing.

---

### 3.2 Meta-Layer Operators

**Operator:** `##`

**Definition:** Marks meta-commentary or structural notes.

**Usage Rule:** Use for documentation notes, not runtime logic.

**Example:**

```
## This section explains the rationale for the patch.
```

---

### 3.3 Probability Operators

**Operator:** `%%`

**Definition:** Indicates probability, weighting, or confidence.

**Usage Rule:** Use for statistical or confidence-based statements.

**Example:**

> The agent resolves the conflict with %%0.82 confidence.

---

### 3.4 Abstraction Operators

**Operator:** `^^`

**Definition:** Elevates the perspective to a higher abstraction layer.

**Usage Rule:** Use when shifting from implementation to conceptual view.

**Example:**

> ^^From the governance layer, the drift is minimal.

---

### 3.5 Strength Operators

**Operator:** `**` (wraps content)

**Definition:** Marks a strong assertion or foundational rule.

**Usage Rule:** Use for non-negotiable doctrine statements.

**Example:**

> **Identity anchors must remain consistent across migrations.**

---

### 3.6 Inline Note Operators

**Operator:** `//`

**Definition:** Provides a brief inline comment or justification.

**Usage Rule:** Use for short, non-structural notes.

**Example:**

> This step is skipped // deprecated in 4.1.18.

---

### 3.7 Soft Transition Operators

**Operator:** `~~>`

**Definition:** Indicates a gentle or partial transition.

**Usage Rule:** Use when moving between states without a hard boundary.

**Example:**

> After stabilization, we ~~> begin resonance mapping.

---

## 4. Cursor Enforcement Rules

**Bridging Rule (Kernel–Lens):** Kernel first; lens optional; no drift across layers; lens may reinterpret but never redefine; kernel meaning is always recoverable and authoritative. Full formulation: [SEMANTIC_LENSES_DOCTRINE](SEMANTIC_LENSES_DOCTRINE.md) §2.1.

- Cursor **must preserve** all operators exactly as written.
- Cursor **must not** reinterpret operators as Markdown formatting.
- Cursor **must not** remove, collapse, or normalize symbolic operators.
- Cursor **must treat** operators as part of the semantic grammar.
- Cursor **must not** introduce new operators unless explicitly defined in doctrine.
- Cursor **must maintain** spacing and placement exactly as provided.
- Cursor **must not** convert operators into emojis, HTML, or alternative symbols.

## 6. Doctrine-Safe Operator Examples

Each sentence shows multiple operators in realistic Lupopedia / Crafty Syntax context.

**1.**  
> The [[Resonance Table]] updated @@ +4 rows and now maps EmotionalState::CALM with %%0.91 confidence.

**2.**  
> All identity anchors must route through ||Captain Wolfie|| before proceeding >> to the next migration step.

**3.**  
> The subsystem is ~~stable, but <<under high load>> it begins to drift?? requiring immediate !!attention.

**4.**  
> Kernel-Agent::CURSOR must preserve **all symbolic operators** // non‑negotiable under doctrine 4.1.18.

**5.**  
> ^^From the governance layer, the [[Polymorphic Meta‑Table]] appears consistent, though inheritance rules remain unclear??

**6.**  
> After normalization, we ~~> transition into the [[Emotional Geometry Engine]] calibration phase.

**7.**  

```
## This block documents the rationale behind the @@ patch applied to the ContextShift::Module.
```

**8.**  
> The agent's prediction vector outputs %%0.73 alignment with the intended doctrine, requiring >> refinement.

**9.**  
> <<During the first Pack migration>> the system established ||Wolf Protocol|| as the canonical identity schema.

**10.**  
> The resonance mapping is **required** before enabling [[Semantic OS Layer 3]] ~~> otherwise drift compounds!!
