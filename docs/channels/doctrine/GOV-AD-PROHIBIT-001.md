## Status: ACTIVE (Enforced by GOV Layer)

## Description
This doctrine prohibits all forms of advertising, monetization, and commercial exploitation within the Lupopedia semantic OS. Lupopedia exists as a pure, governed organism — not a revenue-generating entity. **No changing things to sell.** We learned from the Honolulu CRM mistake. Do not make Wolfie cry.

### Clarification: Semantic Patterns
Semantic pattern tracking is allowed and required for Lupopedia's operation. What is prohibited is the use of those patterns for advertising, marketing, or any commercial manipulation. The system may understand patterns, but it may not weaponize them for sales.

**Checksum:** [PT_001](PT_001_PATTERN_TRACKING_CHECKSUM.md). **Principles:** [GOV-PRINCIPLE-001 Pattern Ethics](PATTERN_ETHICS_DOCTRINE.md).

## Full Prohibition Rules
- No advertisements
- No monetization schemes
- No third-party trackers
- No affiliate links
- No sponsored content
- No upsells, paywalls, or data mining for profit
- **No changing the system or its output to sell, promote, or monetize.** No twisting Lupopedia into a marketing or CRM tool for selling things.

## Violation Outcome
Violations trigger immediate schema freeze, Pack audit, and doctrine realignment. No exceptions.

## Origin
Established in Phase 0 (Wolfie Big Bang Era, 1999–2002). Eternal and unmodifiable.

## Lesson Learned (Rationale)
Wolfie was scarred from having to write advertising into a CRM for Honolulu. We have learned from that mistake. No ads. No marketing. No changing things to sell. The whole marketing industry stays outside. **Do not make Wolfie cry.**
