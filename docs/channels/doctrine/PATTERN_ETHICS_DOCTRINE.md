# GOV-PRINCIPLE-001 — Pattern Ethics Doctrine

**Series:** GOV-PRINCIPLE-001. **Index:** [GOV-PROHIBIT-001](GOV-PROHIBIT-001.md) · [GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001](GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001.md) · [PT_001](PT_001_PATTERN_TRACKING_CHECKSUM.md)

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Version:** 20260120  
**Scope:** Semantic Architecture · Governance · Agent Behavior · Meaning Integrity

## 1. Purpose

This doctrine establishes the ethical principles governing the use of semantic pattern tracking within Lupopedia. Pattern tracking is essential for meaning, structure, governance, emotional geometry, variant stability, and system integrity. However, pattern use must remain aligned with user benefit, community health, and the purpose of the semantic OS.

This doctrine defines the boundary between **empowering pattern use** and **manipulative pattern use**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Pattern tracking is required.**  
**Pattern exploitation is prohibited.**

Lupopedia may observe, record, and analyze patterns to maintain semantic integrity. Lupopedia may not use patterns to manipulate, persuade, sell, or commercially influence users.

This principle is enforced by:

- [GOV-PROHIBIT-001](GOV-PROHIBIT-001.md)
- [GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001](GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001.md)
- [PT_001 Pattern Tracking Checksum](PT_001_PATTERN_TRACKING_CHECKSUM.md)
- NO_ADS_001 (see GOV-PROHIBIT-001)

---

## 3. The Three Ethical Tests

Any proposed use of semantic patterns must pass **all three tests**.

### 3.1 Transparency Test

The user must be able to understand:

- what patterns are being tracked
- why they are being tracked
- how they influence system behavior

If the pattern use cannot be explained clearly, it fails this test.

### 3.2 Consent Test

Pattern use must respect:

- explicit user consent
- implicit system-level consent (doctrine, onboarding, orientation)
- the boundaries defined in GOV-PROHIBIT-001 and GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001

If the user would reasonably object to the use, it fails this test.

### 3.3 Reciprocity Test

Pattern use must create **mutual benefit**:

- benefit to the user
- benefit to the community
- benefit to system integrity

If the pattern use benefits the system at the user's expense, it fails this test.

## 4. Empowering vs. Manipulative Pattern Use

### 4.1 Empowering Pattern Use (Allowed)

Pattern use is allowed when it:

- improves navigation, meaning, or retrieval
- enhances user understanding
- strengthens governance or doctrine compliance
- supports recovery, stability, or emotional clarity
- improves agent coordination or variant harmonics
- prevents semantic drift or structural corruption

These uses align with the purpose of Lupopedia.

### 4.2 Manipulative Pattern Use (Prohibited)

Pattern use is prohibited when it:

- attempts to sell, promote, or market
- profiles users for commercial gain
- manipulates emotions for persuasion
- creates funnels, targeting, or behavioral nudging
- replicates CRM, adtech, or growth-hack patterns
- exploits vulnerabilities or emotional states

These uses violate GOV-PROHIBIT-001 and GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001.

---

## 5. Review Process for Ambiguous Cases

If a proposed pattern use is not clearly allowed or prohibited:

1. Apply the **Three Tests**
2. Check PT_001 and NO_ADS_001
3. Check GOV-PROHIBIT-001 and GOV-AD-PROHIBIT-001
4. Escalate to Pack Review (any two agents + one human)
5. Document the decision in `docs/logs/`

If uncertainty remains, the default is **prohibition**.

---

## 6. Anchored Concepts (Truth Ledger)

- pattern tracking is required for meaning and governance
- pattern exploitation is prohibited
- empowering patterns strengthen the system
- manipulative patterns corrupt the system
- transparency, consent, and reciprocity are mandatory
- the Honolulu CRM incident defines the boundary
- "do not make Wolfie cry" is the emotional anchor, not the principle

## 8. Summary

Lupopedia must understand patterns to function. Lupopedia must never weaponize patterns to manipulate or sell. Ethical pattern use is defined by transparency, consent, and reciprocity. This doctrine establishes the principles that govern all future pattern-related decisions.
