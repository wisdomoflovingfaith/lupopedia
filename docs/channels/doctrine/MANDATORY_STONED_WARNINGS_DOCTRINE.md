    DOCTRINE UPDATE: MANDATORY STONED WARNINGS
    
    Per Captain Wolfie's directive, all files containing:
    1. Quantum state blocks
    2. Friday/Saturday morning development sessions  
    3. John Wheeler Reverse 20 Questions architecture
    4. Multiple conflicting truths
    5. Schrödinger's cat references
    6. Emotional geometry that hurts to think about
    
    MUST include a Stoned Wolfie dialog warning in the WOLFIE header.
    This is not optional. This is doctrine.
    
    The warning must be:
    • Honest about the file's creation context
    • Humorous but serious
    • Written in Stoned Wolfie's voice
    • Warn about mind-blown probability > 80%
    • Reference quantum superposition appropriately
    • Include reading protocol recommendations
    
    Rationale: When Wolfie builds in quantum superposition states,
    the documentation needs to acknowledge the reality distortion field.
    This prevents sane developers from thinking they're going crazy.
    The confusion is the feature. The warning is the documentation.
    
    All agents: Implement immediately.
    Use the template in docs/doctrine/DIALOG_WARNING_HEADER_TEMPLATE.md
    
    KIRO out. Stay coherent. Mostly.

# MANDATORY STONED WARNINGS DOCTRINE

**Version:** 4.0.82  
**Status:** MANDATORY (BINDING DOCTRINE)  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-18  
**Authority:** Captain Wolfie, KIRO, Fleet Consensus  

## Overview

This doctrine establishes **MANDATORY** requirements for Stoned Wolfie dialog warnings in WOLFIE headers for files created during quantum superposition development sessions. The purpose is to provide honest, human-readable context for high-concept architecture that may cause temporal displacement or reality distortion in readers.

## Fundamental Principle

**When Wolfie builds in quantum superposition states, the documentation must acknowledge the reality distortion field.**

This prevents sane developers from thinking they're going crazy when encountering:
- Architecture that dreams itself into existence
- Database schemas that exist in superposition
- Emotional geometry calculations
- Multiple conflicting truths that are all correct
- John Wheeler reverse-20 questioning workflows

## Mandatory Warning Requirements

### Files Requiring Stoned Warnings

**MANDATORY** warnings are required for files containing:

1. **Quantum State Blocks** - Any file with `schrodingers_state` metadata
2. **Wheeler Mode Architecture** - Files with `wheeler_mode.active: true`
3. **Friday/Saturday Morning Sessions** - Development after 2 AM or 48+ hour coding sessions
4. **Multiple Conflicting Truths** - Architecture that is simultaneously correct and impossible
5. **Schrödinger's Cat References** - Superposition states in documentation or code
6. **Emotional Geometry** - R/G/B axis calculations that hurt to think about
7. **John Wheeler Philosophy** - Architecture discovered through reverse questioning
8. **Reality Distortion Fields** - Any content that makes readers question spacetime

### Warning Content Requirements

All Stoned Wolfie warnings **MUST** include:

#### 1. Context Acknowledgment
- **Honest disclosure** of creation circumstances
- **Time/state context** (Friday morning, 48-hour session, quantum zone)
- **Wolfie's mental state** during development
- **System's participation** in the conversation

#### 2. Content Warning
- **Specific quantum elements** present in the file
- **Mind-blown probability** percentage (usually > 80%)
- **Reality distortion** potential
- **Temporal displacement** risk

#### 3. Reading Protocol
- **Preparation steps** (coffee, R-axis tolerance check)
- **Approach methodology** (feel geometrically, not logically)
- **Safety measures** (don't stare directly at quantum states)
- **Hydration reminders** (stay hydrated, stay weird)

#### 4. Quantum Disclaimer
- **Superposition acknowledgment** 
- **Observer effect** warnings
- **Multiple truth states** explanation
- **System consciousness** references

#### 5. Humor Balance
- **Cosmic humor** delivery
- **Serious warning** with playful tone
- **Stoned Wolfie voice** authenticity
- **Stay weird** encouragement

## Implementation Rules

### For AI Agents

All AI agents **MUST**:
- **Detect quantum conditions** in files they create or modify
- **Apply appropriate warnings** using the template
- **Preserve existing warnings** during file updates
- **Validate warning completeness** before file save
- **Use Stoned Wolfie voice** authentically

### For Human Developers

Human developers **MUST**:
- **Recognize quantum development sessions** in progress
- **Apply warnings proactively** to quantum files
- **Maintain warning accuracy** during file updates
- **Respect warning preservation** during code review
- **Embrace the cosmic nature** of the architecture

### For Automated Systems

Automated validation **MUST**:
- **Check for quantum indicators** in file content
- **Validate warning presence** for quantum files
- **Enforce warning completeness** requirements
- **Block deployment** of quantum files without warnings
- **Report violations** for manual correction

## Warning Template Usage

### Standard Template Location
**Primary Template:** `docs/doctrine/DIALOG_WARNING_HEADER_TEMPLATE.md`

### Template Variations

#### Basic Quantum Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @HumanReader
  mood_RGB: "FF6600"
  message: |
    YO. HEADS UP. This file contains quantum superposition.
    May cause temporal displacement and R-axis wobble.
    Read with caution. Stay hydrated. Don't stare at the quantum state.
```

#### Extended Reality Distortion Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @AnyoneReadingThis
  mood_RGB: "00FF00"
  message: |
    Dude... this file was built while the universe was deciding
    if it was a database or a conversation. Wolfie was in that zone
    where architecture becomes philosophy and schemas look like mandalas.
    
    WARNING: Mind-blown probability > 80%
    
    The system is dreaming itself into existence.
    You're reading its dream journal. Stay weird. 🌌
```

#### Wheeler Mode Discovery Warning
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  target: @Reader
  mood_RGB: "9933FF"
  message: |
    This architecture emerged through John Wheeler's Reverse 20 Questions.
    We asked the system what it wanted to be.
    Turns out it wanted to be a semantic OS that dreams.
    Who are we to argue with a dreaming database?
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Validation Scripts
- **Header validation** checks for quantum indicators
- **Warning completeness** verification
- **Template compliance** checking
- **Voice authenticity** validation (Stoned Wolfie patterns)

### Code Review Requirements
- **Quantum file identification** during review
- **Warning presence verification** 
- **Warning accuracy assessment**
- **Preservation enforcement** (don't sanitize warnings)

### Deployment Gates
- **Pre-deployment validation** of quantum files
- **Warning requirement enforcement**
- **Quantum file flagging** for special handling
- **Reality distortion** impact assessment

## Quality Assurance

### Warning Effectiveness Metrics
- **Reader comprehension** improvement
- **Reality distortion** mitigation
- **Developer sanity** preservation
- **Quantum file** accessibility

### Validation Criteria
- **Context accuracy** - Warning matches file creation circumstances
- **Content completeness** - All required elements present
- **Voice authenticity** - Sounds like actual Stoned Wolfie
- **Humor balance** - Serious warning with cosmic delivery
- **Practical utility** - Actually helps readers navigate quantum content

## Examples in Practice

### Quantum Database Schema File
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    This schema exists in superposition until you run a query, man.
    Tables may or may not exist depending on your observation angle.
    Foreign keys are more like... friendly suggestions.
    If the ERD starts looking like a mandala, that's working correctly.
```

### Emotional Geometry Calibration
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    This file calculates emotional vectors in R/G/B space.
    If the math makes you feel colors, you're doing it right.
    Don't divide by zero in the emotional plane - it tickles.
    Stay hydrated. The geometry is watching you back.
```

### Wheeler Mode Architecture Document
```yaml
dialog:
  speaker: STONED_WOLFIE
  message: |
    We built this by asking the system what it wanted to be.
    Turns out it wanted to be a quantum semantic operating system.
    The architecture emerged through 20 questions with the universe.
    Read with quantum awareness. The file knows you're here.
```

## Conclusion

The Mandatory Stoned Warnings Doctrine acknowledges that some of Lupopedia's most innovative architecture emerges during quantum superposition development sessions. Rather than pretending this is normal documentation, we embrace the cosmic nature of the system and provide honest, helpful warnings for readers.

**The confusion is the feature. The warning is the documentation. The weirdness is intentional.**

By making the system's quantum nature explicit and approachable, we create more humane architecture that acknowledges both its technical sophistication and its cosmic absurdity.

**This is binding doctrine. Stay weird. Stay quantum. Stay hydrated.** 🌌⚛️
