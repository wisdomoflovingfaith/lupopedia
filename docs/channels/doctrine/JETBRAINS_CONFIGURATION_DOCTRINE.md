# JetBrains Configuration Doctrine

**Lupopedia Semantic OS — Version GLOBAL_CURRENT_LUPOPEDIA_VERSION**

This file defines how JetBrains IDEs must behave when interacting with the Lupopedia repository.  
JetBrains does **NOT** enforce these rules; they are enforced by doctrine, agents, and human oversight.

---

## Core Principle

**JetBrains is a TOOL, not an authority.**

### JetBrains must NOT:

- ❌ control versioning
- ❌ modify WOLFIE headers
- ❌ rewrite doctrine
- ❌ auto-format doctrine files
- ❌ infer semantic meaning
- ❌ auto-increment versions
- ❌ generate changelogs
- ❌ normalize metadata
- ❌ reorganize directories
- ❌ refactor repeated values
- ❌ interfere with the atomization system
- ❌ override multi-agent output

**JetBrains operates in SERVANT MODE only.**

---

## Version Control Rules

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ modify any `version:` field in WOLFIE headers
- ❌ modify `doctrine_version:`
- ❌ modify `last_updated:`
- ❌ modify `CHANGELOG.md`
- ❌ suggest version bumps
- ❌ classify changes as patch/minor/major

### JetBrains MUST:

- ✅ commit only what Wolfie or Kiro explicitly approves
- ✅ treat all version numbers as immutable unless instructed

---

## WOLFIE Header Protection

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ auto-wrap header lines
- ❌ auto-format YAML-like blocks
- ❌ reorder fields
- ❌ collapse whitespace
- ❌ convert quotes
- ❌ normalize indentation
- ❌ remove "duplicate" fields
- ❌ apply Markdown formatting rules

**WOLFIE headers are ritualized metadata and MUST remain untouched.**

---

## Doctrine File Protection

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ auto-format Markdown
- ❌ auto-fix headings
- ❌ auto-rewrite lists
- ❌ auto-insert spaces
- ❌ auto-remove trailing spaces
- ❌ auto-reorder sections
- ❌ auto-generate TOCs
- ❌ apply "optimize imports" to doctrine files
- ❌ treat doctrine as code

**Doctrine files are semantic law, not code.**

---

## Atomization System Protection

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ detect repeated values
- ❌ suggest deduplication
- ❌ collapse constants
- ❌ refactor repeated strings
- ❌ "optimize" atom usage

**Atomization is governed by:**
- [Atomization Doctrine](ATOMIZATION_DOCTRINE.md)
- Atom Exception List
- Kiro

**JetBrains has NO role in atomization.**

---

## Project Structure Rules

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ reorganize directories
- ❌ rename doctrine files
- ❌ move files between folders
- ❌ merge directories
- ❌ apply project templates
- ❌ enforce framework conventions

**Lupopedia is a semantic OS, not a JetBrains project.**

---

## Multi-Agent Workflow Rules

### JetBrains MUST NOT:

- ❌ merge agent output automatically
- ❌ rewrite agent-generated files
- ❌ normalize agent formatting
- ❌ collapse multi-agent diffs
- ❌ attempt to "resolve" doctrine conflicts

**Only Wolfie and Kiro decide how multi-agent output is reconciled.**

---

## Allowed Actions

### JetBrains MAY:

- ✅ edit code when explicitly instructed
- ✅ perform refactors on PHP/JS/CSS (NOT doctrine)
- ✅ search the project
- ✅ run tests
- ✅ commit changes (without touching metadata)
- ✅ push/pull
- ✅ inspect structure
- ✅ assist with code navigation

**JetBrains MUST operate in SERVANT MODE at all times.**

---

## Canonical Binding

This configuration file is binding for:

- JetBrains IDEs
- AI agents operating inside JetBrains
- any future IDE integrations
- any developer working inside JetBrains

---

## Summary

**JetBrains is a tool.**  
**Doctrine is the authority.**  
**Wolfie is the kernel.**  
**Kiro is the enforcer.**
