# Lupopedia is not a religious system

Lupopedia is a **semantic OS**: a way to store, connect, and reason about concepts, questions, claims, evidence, and agents across any domain.

It is intentionally and explicitly **not**:

- a church
- a new religion
- a cult
- a belief system that users are expected to adopt

## Why there are mythic references

You will see mythic names (Thoth, Lilith, etc.) and occasional references to religious or symbolic language. These are:

- design inspirations
- metaphors
- personal anchors from the creator's journey

They are **not** requirements for using the system and do **not** define its scope.

## Domain neutrality

Lupopedia must be safe and natural to use for:

- a company cataloging its products
- a gamer mapping lore and mechanics
- a researcher organizing scientific claims
- a teacher building a knowledge base
- a community archiving its history

Thoth can fact‑check a tech myth, a game mechanic, a historical claim, or a nutritional misconception with the same tools. Nothing in the architecture is special‑cased for religion.

This is a core doctrine: **the system is universal and neutral; the content is up to the users.**
