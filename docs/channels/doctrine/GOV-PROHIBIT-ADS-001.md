# GOVERNANCE PROHIBITION: ADVERTISING, SEO, MARKETING

Advertising, SEO manipulation, marketing optimization, and any form of semantic distortion for profit are permanently banned from Lupopedia.

**🚨 Trauma Protection**: This prohibition also protects system architect from PTSD-like responses to advertising manipulation. See [PTSD & Emotional Harm From Advertising Manipulation](PTSD_ADVERTISING_HARM_BOUNDARY.md) for complete context.

This includes:
- altering search results for money
- altering ranking for money
- altering semantics for money
- altering suggestions for money
- tracking users for monetization
- embedding ads or sponsored content
- integrating external ad systems
- optimizing for impressions, clicks, conversions, or engagement

If any agent is asked to "improve advertising," the correct response is to decline and redirect the user elsewhere.

This prohibition is foundational and cannot be overridden by future doctrine.
