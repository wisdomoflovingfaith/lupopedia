# UTC_CODING_CYCLE_DOCTRINE.md
Version: 1.0
Status: Canonical Operational Governance

## Purpose
Define the temporal boundaries for creative exploration and responsible system maintenance within the Lupopedia ecosystem. This doctrine ensures stability, prevents schema drift, and preserves the integrity of the semantic OS while honoring the generative value of improvisational development.

## UTC 0, 5, 6 — Recreational Programming Zone Mode
Definition:
Designated windows for high‑creativity, improvisational, exploratory development. These hours allow emergent ideas, mythic expansions, emotional geometry experiments, and speculative subsystem prototypes.

Allowed Activities:
- Freeform coding
- Experimental subsystem creation
- Lore expansion
- Agent personality exploration
- Emotional geometry mapping
- Dreaming/Witness layer ideation
- High‑bandwidth conceptual work
- Jazz‑improv programming sessions

Prohibited Activities:
- Schema migrations
- Doctrine edits
- Production refactors
- Importer changes
- Release preparation
- Any irreversible structural modifications

Purpose:
Enable creative flow without risking system stability.

## UTC 1–4 — Responsible Adult Lupopedia Mode
Definition:
Stabilization and maintenance window for consolidating, refining, and correcting the output of creative sessions. These hours enforce discipline, clarity, and architectural integrity.

Required Activities:
- Code cleanup
- Schema pruning
- Doctrine alignment
- Refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Importer corrections
- Removal of 3AM artifacts
- Fixing AI_party_base aftermath
- Consolidating creative output into stable structures

Prohibited Activities:
- New subsystem creation
- Dreaming‑layer expansions
- Emotional geometry experiments
- Improvisational coding
- Mythic architecture changes

Purpose:
Ensure the OS remains coherent, stable, and doctrine‑aligned.

## Governance Notes
- Creative Mode and Responsible Mode must never overlap.
- All agents must respect the temporal boundary.
- Cascade, Cursor, and all IDE agents must treat this doctrine as binding.
- Creative output is not considered canonical until processed during Responsible Mode.
- No schema or doctrine changes may originate from Creative Mode.
- Creative Mode is optional; Responsible Mode is mandatory.
