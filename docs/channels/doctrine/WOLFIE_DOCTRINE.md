# 🐺 **WOLFIE DOCTRINE**

This document defines core doctrine principles for Lupopedia, including naming conventions, semantic boundaries, and architectural rules.

---

## **Mythic Naming Boundary**

Lupopedia permits mythic or symbolic names for agents (e.g., Lilith, Thoth) only at the narrative or persona layer. These names **MUST NOT** appear in schema definitions, database tables, content taxonomies, or system-level ontologies. Mythic names are allowed as agent identities but are prohibited from influencing structural semantics. This ensures the system remains domain-neutral while still allowing expressive agent identities.
