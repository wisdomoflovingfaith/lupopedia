  title: 04. Lupopedia JS Foundation (The Nerves) - 4.0.93
  summary: ''
---
**RULE [93.PROTECT_SCHEMA_JSON]** (formerly PROTECT_TOONS): JS event logic must reference actual database schema from `database/lupopedia/json/*.json`, not assumed structures. All schema evolution must be verified with `generate_toon_files.py`. See `00_root_constitutional_system_requirements.md` ????6 and ????9.9.

**LILITH Verdict**: The "Nerves" must connect to the real "Senses" (database schema) not imagined structures.

## Canonical clarification: what a channel is (and is not)

In Lupopedia, a channel is a semantic container inside a domain (node).
It is NOT a Discord room, Slack channel, chat feed, or conversation thread.

**Hierarchy**

```text
Domain (node)
  -> Channel (semantic container)
      -> Thread (artifact)
          -> Messages, memory, atoms, PRDs, and other scoped artifacts
```

**Definition**

- **Channel** = a governed semantic container that defines scope, meaning, and memory boundaries.
- **Thread** = a single conversational artifact inside a channel.
- **Threads do not contain channels. Channels contain threads.**

**Required warning (normative where channels are defined):** Channels are semantic containers, not conversational rooms. They define scope, governance, and meaning for all threads within them.

**Schema keys:** `channel_key`, `channel_id`, and related channel metadata keep their existing names; this section clarifies semantics only (no field renames).

## Context????????Typed, Status????????Aware, Directional Edged Memory Doctrine (4.0.96)

1. Memory in Lupopedia is represented as a directed graph of nodes and edges. 
  Each memory node is a first-class entity in the semantic network and may be 
  owned by actors, departments, auth_users, channels, federation nodes, or the 
  global system.

2. Every edge in the memory graph has FOUR dimensions:
  - **edge type** (the relationship)
  - **edge context** (the classification of the memory)
  - **edge status** (the epistemic support level)
  - **edge direction** (the traversal orientation)

3. **Edge Direction** defines whether the relationship is:
  - unidirectional (A ???????? B)
  - bidirectional (A ???????? B)
  - restricted-direction (A ???????? B but not B ???????? A unless explicitly defined)
  Reverse traversal MUST NOT be inferred unless explicitly defined.

4. **Edge Type** defines the relationship between nodes, including but not 
  limited to:
  - influences
  - inherits
  - authored_by
  - observed_by
  - contradicts
  - supports
  - consolidates_from
  - refines
  - overrides

5. **Edge Context** defines the classification of the memory node. Context is 
  not based on the content of the memory, but on the structural support 
  provided by the graph. The primary context classifications are:
  - doctrine
  - experiential
  - system_generated
  - countermeasure_generated
  - summary
  - contradictory
  - deprecated

6. **Edge Status** defines the epistemic support level of the memory node:
  - **unsupported**: insufficient supporting edges; provisional memory.
  - **supported**: sufficient supporting edges; validated memory.
  - **needs_review**: conflicting, incomplete, or ambiguous edges requiring 
    agent or human intervention.

7. When `edge_status = 'needs_review'`, a **review_reason** MUST be provided. 
  This field explains *why* the edge requires review and *which agent* should 
  handle it. Examples include:
  - orphaned_edge
  - contradiction
  - new_doctrine
  - schema_drift
  - consolidation_candidate
  - integrity_unknown
  - human_escalation

  Agents use this field to determine their work queues:
  - ANUBIS handles: integrity_unknown, orphaned_edge
  - THOTH handles: schema_drift, contradiction, new_doctrine
  - KAIROS handles: consolidation_candidate
  - Human operator handles: human_escalation

8. Memory nodes may transition between statuses as edges are added, removed, 
  or reclassified. A node may move from unsupported ???????? supported when 
  sufficient supporting edges accumulate.

9. Actors inherit memory edges from:
  - their department
  - their auth_user
  - their federation node
  - their assigned faucets
  - their assigned tasks

10. Memory traversal is context-aware and direction-aware. Actors may only 
   traverse edges permitted by their boundaries, department rules, auth_user 
   pairing, faucet assignments, and operational mode (live, simulation, 
   analysis).

11. No inference is allowed. All edges, contexts, statuses, directions, and 
   review reasons must be explicitly defined in PRDs, database rows, or 
   system-generated memory.

12. Memory is not a flat file. It is a structured, typed, classified, 
   status-aware, direction-aware graph. Traversal depth determines visible 
   memory; deeper traversal reveals more context, subject to boundary rules.

13. All changes to memory structure, edge types, edge contexts, edge statuses, 
   edge directions, or review reasons must be documented in PRDs and versioned.
